Saturn V was an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle 
certified for human-rating used by NASA between 1967 and 
1973. It consisted of three stages, each fueled by liquid 
propellants. It was developed to support the Apollo program 
for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to 
launch Skylab, the first American space station.

The Saturn V was launched 13 times from Kennedy Space Center 
with no loss of crew or payload. As of 2020, the Saturn V 
remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest 
total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, 
and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and 
largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of 
310,000 lbs (140,000 kg), which included the third stage 
and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command 
and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon.

As the largest production model of the Saturn family of 
rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of 
Wernher von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, 
Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors.

To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry 
humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15 flight-capable 
vehicles were built, but only 13 were flown. An additional 
three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes. A total 
of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon in the four years 
spanning December 1968 through December 1972.

In September 1945, the US government brought the German rocket technologist 
Wernher von Braun and about seven hundred German rocket engineers and 
technicians to the United States for Operation Paperclip, a program authorized 
by President Truman.

Von Braun was assigned to the Army's rocket design division due to his 
prior direct involvement in the creation of the V-2 rocket. Between 1945 
and 1958, his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind 
the V-2 to American engineers. Despite von Braun's many articles on the 
future of space rocketry, the US government continued funding Air Force 
and Navy rocket programs to test their Vanguard missiles despite numerous 
costly failures.

The US Army and government began taking serious steps towards sending 
Americans into space in 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 atop 
an R-7 ICBM, which is capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead to the 
US. They turned to von Braun's team, who had created and experimented 
with the Jupiter series of rockets. 

The Juno I rocket launched the first American satellite in January 1958, 
and was part of the last-ditch plan for NACA (the predecessor of NASA) to 
participate in the Space Race. Von Braun considered the Jupiter series to 
be a prototype and referred to it as "an infant Saturn".

Soyuz-2 (GRAU index 14A14) is a modernised version of the Russian Soyuz rocket. In 
its basic form, it is a three-stage carrier rocket for placing payloads into low Earth 
orbit. Compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz, the first-stage boosters and two 
core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems. Digital flight 
control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, 
whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket 
could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.

Soyuz-2 is often flown with an upper stage, which allows it to lift payloads into higher 
orbits, such as Molniya and geosynchronous orbits. The upper stage is equipped with 
independent flight control and telemetry systems from those used in the rest of the rocket. 
The NPO Lavochkin manufactured Fregat is the most commonly used upper stage.

Soyuz-2 rockets were first launched from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and Site 43 
at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived rockets 
including the Soyuz-U and Molniya. Commercial Soyuz-2 flights are contracted by Starsem 
and have launched from Site 31 at Baikonur Cosmodrome and ELS (Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz), 
which has been built at the Centre Spatial Guyanais on the northern coast of South America. 
The Soyuz-2 version ST-B can deliver 3,250 kilograms (7,170 lbs) to geostationary transfer 
orbit (GTO) from this equatorial site. In 2016, the new Vostochny Cosmodrome started operating 
Soyuz-2 flights as well, from its first launch pad called Site 1S.

The Soyuz-2 has replaced the Molniya-M, Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG since 2010, 2017 and 2019 respectively. 
TsSKB-Progress halted production of Soyuz-U in April 2015; the final flight of a Soyuz-U rocket took 
place on 22 February 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station. According to 
CNES officials interviewed in May 2018, launches of Soyuz from Guiana may be replaced by the Ariane 
6 medium-lift version A62 in 2021.

---Variants---
The Soyuz-2 family includes 2.1a, 2.1b, and 2.1v. The first two variants are modifications to the 
Soyuz-U launcher. The latter is a "light" version without side boosters.

When launched from the Kourou site, Soyuz-2 is always mated with the ST-type fairing; this version 
is called Soyuz-ST or Soyuz-STK, where additional "K" indicates special measures taken for preparing 
and launching the rocket in hot and humid conditions.


Soyuz-2.1a
The 2.1a version includes conversion from analog to digital flight control system and uprated 
engines on the booster and the first stage with improved injection systems. The new digital flight
control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to launch from a fixed rather than angled launch 
platform and adjust its heading in flight. A digital control system also enables the launch of 
larger commercial satellites with wider and longer payload fairings such as the ST-type fairing. 
These fairings introduce too much aerodynamic instability for the old analog system to handle. 
This stage continues to use the RD-0110 engine.

The 2.1a/ST version is sometimes called Soyuz ST-A. The first launch, from Guiana, (17 December 
2011 for Pléiades-HR 1A, SSOT, ELISA (4 satellites)) was a success.

Soyuz-2.1b
The 2.1b version adds an upgraded engine (RD-0124) which greatly increases the specific impulse 
of the upper stage (326 seconds to 359 seconds). First launch took place from Plesetsk Cosmodrome 
Site 43 on 26 July 2008 with a classified military payload.

The 2.1b/ST version is sometimes called Soyuz ST-B. The first launch, from Guiana, was a success 
(21 October 2011), for the first two Galileo IOV satellites.

Soyuz-2.1v
Main article: Soyuz-2.1v
The first flight vehicle of the 2.1v version was finished in 2009. It is a "light" version of 
the Soyuz-2 without the side boosters (blocks B, V, G and D[clarification needed]). The Block A 
engine was replaced by the more powerful NK-33-1, which as of 2009, was to eventually be replaced 
with the RD-193.[needs update] The new launcher version was able to deliver up to 2.8 tonnes in 
low Earth orbit.

            The Delta III rocket was an expendable launch vehicle made by 
            Boeing. The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of 
            its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, 
            though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted 
            orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta 
            III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its 
            predecessor, the Delta II. Under the 4-digit designation system 
            from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the 
            Delta 8930.

            Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene 
            and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main 
            engine with two vernier engines for roll control. While the 
            propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical 
            to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased 
            from 2.4 meters to 4 meters. This reduced the overall length of 
            the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch 
            facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications. First 
            stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, 
            sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). 
            These were 14.7 meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, 
            and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about 6 metric tons more than 
            the Delta II's standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch 
            pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and 
            separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, 
            three of the boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would 
            later find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.

--Launches--
Delta Flight 259: The inaugural launch on August 26, 1998 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ended in failure, when software adapted from the Delta II caused a guidance failure during first-stage flight. The failure and subsequent vehicle motion depleted the hydraulic fluid used for steering. Upon loss of control, the vehicle was destroyed. The Galaxy 10 satellite (Hughes HS601 HP type) was destroyed.

Delta Flight 269: The second launch on May 4, 1999, carrying the Orion 3 satellite (Hughes HS601 model), also ended in failure. The second stage engine experienced a pressure anomaly and rupture, and shut down while its second burn was underway, leaving the payload in a useless orbit.

Delta Flight 280: The third and final flight on August 23, 2000 launched a 4,348 kg (9,586 lb) satellite simulator into a 180.76 × 20,694 km orbit. While the apogee was 2,710 km lower than the targeted 185 × 23,404 km, and somewhat a partial failure, it was within the allowable 3,000 km margin of error and demonstrated the propellant depletion shutdown capability of the DCSS, modified versions of which would become the second stage of the Delta IV.

            Ariane 6 is a launch vehicle developed and manufactured by 
            ArianeGroup under the authority of the European Space Agency 
            (ESA), with a first test flight scheduled for 2020 or, now 
            more likely, 2021. When development is completed, it will 
            become the newest member in the Ariane launch vehicle family. 
            The final design was selected in December 2014, favoring a 
            liquid-fuelled core with large solid rocket boosters over the 
            initial solid-fuel rocket design. The motivation for 
            Ariane 6 development was to replace Ariane 5 at half the cost, 
            and allow double the number of launches each year.

            Ariane 6 was initially conceived in the early 2010s as a 
            replacement launch vehicle for Ariane 5, and a number of 
            concepts and high-level designs were suggested and proposed 
            during 2012–2015. Funding from several European governments 
            was secured by early 2016, and contracts were signed to begin 
            detailed design and the build of test articles. While in 2019, 
            the maiden orbital flight had been planned for 2020, by May 
            2020, the planned initial launch date had been delayed until 2021.

Two variants of Ariane 6 are being developed:

Ariane 62, with two P120 solid boosters, will weigh around 530 tonnes (1,170,000 lbs) at liftoff and is intended mainly for government and scientific missions. It can launch up to 5,000 kg (11,000 lbs) into GTO and 10,350 kg (22,820 lbs) into LEO.

Ariane 64, with four P120 boosters, has a liftoff weight of around 860 tonnes (1,900,000 lbs) and is intended for commercial dual-satellite launches of up to 11,500 kilograms (25,400 lbs) into GTO and 21,500 kg (47,400 lbs) into LEO. Like Ariane 5, it will be able to launch two geosynchronous satellites together.

Ariane 6 comprises three major structural and propellant-carrying components.

            Tronador (Spanish for Thunderer) is a series of Argentine 
            rockets, including the Tronador I and Tronador II vehicles, 
            to develop a liquid-propellant rocket expendable launch 
            system called ISCUL (Inyector Satelital de Cargas Utiles 
            Ligeras, Light Useful Payloads Satellite Launcher).

            The Tronador I is an unguided liquid-fueled rocket used 
            for sub-orbital spaceflight test flights. Its development 
            led to the larger VEx test rocket, testing technologies 
            needed for the Tronador II, which has a guidance system 
            and would be capable of reaching low Earth orbit. 
            Development of the satellite launch vehicle has cost more 
            than 600 million dollars over several years.
            
Tronador III
The proposed Tronador III would have the same diameter as Tronador II, but would have a length of 34 metres (112 ft). The fueled rocket would weight 89 metric tons, and capable of delivering a ton of payload into polar orbit.

            The VLS-1 (Portuguese: Veículo Lançador de Satélites)
            was the Brazilian Space Agency's main satellite launch 
            vehicle. The launch vehicle was to be capable of 
            launching satellites into orbit. The launch site was 
            located at the Alcântara Launch Center due to its 
            proximity to the equator.

            Associated vehicles include the Sonda I, Sonda II, 
            Sonda III and Sonda IV, the VS-30, VS-40 and VSB-30.

            The VLS was cancelled after decades of development 
            and high expenditures with poor results and a failed 
            association with Ukraine that slowed the program 
            for years.

            VLS-1 development started in 1984, after the first 
            launch of the Sonda IV rocket. To date, three 
            prototypes have been built and two launches attempted, 
            departing from the Alcântara Launch Center. During 
            the V1 and V2 prototype launches (VLS-1 V1 and VLS-1 V2) 
            technical problems prevented mission success, but 
            allowed the testing of several vehicle components. 
            The V3 prototype exploded on the launch pad on 22 
            August 2003, two days before its intended launch date. 
            The 2003 Alcântara VLS accident caused a considerable 
            setback to the Brazilian space program. The V4 
            prototype was expected to be launched in 2016.

            The VLM (Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites) is a 
            proposed three-stage satellite launcher being developed 
            by the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology 
            in collaboration with Germany. The project originated 
            in 2008 as a simplified version of the VLS-1 rocket, 
            using only the core stages.

            A version based on the S-50 rocket engine is being 
            developed, with the objective of launching satellites 
            of up to 150 kg into equatorial circular orbits at 
            300 km altitude.

            Development on VLM started in 2008 for the purpose of 
            low-cost and reliable launch of microsatellites. 
            Initially, a four-stage rocket using solid fuel was 
            proposed, arranged in the following order:

            Stage 1: S-43 rocket engine
            Stage 2: S-40TM rocket engine
            Stage 3: S-44 rocket engine
            Stage 4: S-33 rocket engine

            It was later decided in 2011 to build a precursor 
            single-stage rocket bearing a new engine called S-50. 
            The vehicle is being developed and its engine tested 
            in collaboration with the German Space Agency (DLR).
            This precursor test is called VS-50 and is planned for 
            launch in 2019. The VS-50 vehicle measures 12 m (39 ft) 
            long, 1.46 m (4 ft 9 in) in diameter, and has a mass of 
            about 15 tons.

            All launches are planned to take place from the Alcântara 
            Launch Center, located on Brazil's northern Atlantic coast.

            Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1) was small, solid fueled launch vehicle 
            based on the road mobile DF-21 IRBM with an additional 
            upper stage (in total 4 stages[1]). It was 13.6 meters 
            in length and 1.4 meters in diameter, with launch mass 
            of 20t. It was possible to launch KT-1 both from a 
            truck-based platform or from airborne platform. It had 
            a 100 kg to LEO payload capacity. It was possibly the 
            launch vehicle for a Chinese ASAT system that was tested 
            against an old Chinese weather satellite in 2007.

            The vehicle has performed two flights, the first in 15 
            September 2002 and the second 16 September 2003. The 
            first flight failed to place a 50 kg satellite into 
            polar orbit due to a second stage malfunction. The 
            second flight was also a failure, however Chinese 
            officials declared some success citing the guidance 
            systems, fairing separation and satellite-launcher 
            separation as successful. The second launch sent the 
            payload, PS-2 microsatellite (40 kg) into wrong orbit. 
            The satellite completed barely one orbit before 
            re-entering the atmosphere.

            The Kaituozhe-1 launcher appears to have been cancelled 
            after two unsuccessful launches. A third (in 2004) and 
            fourth launch have been rumored, but are not confirmed.

            The rocket had three variants: the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1), 
            the Kaituozhe-1A (KT-1A, originally designated KT-2, not 
            to be confused with KT-2 below) and the Kaituozhe-1B 
            (KT-1B, originally designated KT-2A, not to be confused 
            with KT-2A below). The rockets that flew were of the KT-1 
            variant. The KT-1A and KT-1B variant rockets were not built.

Kaituozhe-2
Like its predecessor the Kaituozhe-2 (KT-2) is a solid-fueled launch vehicle which could be based on the DF-31 missile. Two versions have been proposed:

Kaituozhe-2
The Kaituozhe-2 (KT-2, AKA Kaituo-2) features a possibly DF-31 based stage 1, topped by a smalled diameter stage 2 and 3. It has reportedly a payload of 800 kg to low earth orbit.

The maiden flight of the Kaituozhe-2 took place at 23:45 UTC on March 2, 2017 from Jiuquan (apparently from one of the two solid rocket launch pads. The rocket placed the Tiankun-1 (TK-1) satellite into polar orbit.

The KT-2 is a rapid-response launcher; the rocket is capable of mobile-launch from a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle.

Kaituozhe-2A
The Kaituozhe-2A (KT-2A) features a possibly DF-31 based stage 1, augmented by two DF-21 based strap-on boosters. It features a stage 2 with the same diameter as the stage 1 and the same smaller diameter stage 3 as the Kaituozhe-2. It has reportedly a payload of 2000 kg to low earth orbit.

            Kuaizhou (KZ, Chinese: 快舟; pinyin: kuàizhōu, meaning 
            "speedy vessel" or "swift boat") (also called Feitian Emergency Satellite 
            Launch System, Feitian-1, FT-1) is a family of Chinese 
            "quick-reaction" orbital launch vehicles. Flying since 
            2013, Kuaizhou 1 and 1A consist of three solid-fueled rocket 
            stages, with a liquid-fueled fourth stage as part of the 
            satellite system. Kuaizhou 11, which flew an unsuccessful 
            maiden flight in July 2020, is a larger model able to launch 
            a 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lbs) payload into low Earth orbit. 
            Heavy-lift models KZ-21 and KZ-31 are in development. The 
            Kuaizhou series of rockets is manufactured by ExPace, a 
            subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation 
            (CASIC), as their commercial launch vehicles.

            The rocket series is based on CASIC's ASAT and BMD mid-course 
            interceptor rockets, in particular the DF-21 IRBM (another 
            Chinese rocket that was based on DF-21 was the Kaituozhe-1). 
            Development on the KZ rockets started in 2009. The KZ rockets
            were to provide an integrated launch vehicle system with the 
            rapid ability to replace Chinese satellites that might be 
            damaged or destroyed in an act of aggression in orbit. The 
            vehicle uses mobile launch platform. The rocket is operated 
            by the Chinese 2nd Artillery.

            The maiden flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 1 
            natural disaster monitoring satellite, occurred on 25 September 
            2013, launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            Second flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 2 natural 
            disaster monitoring satellite, was launched at 06:37 UTC on 21 
            November 2014, again from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            The first commercial launch inaugurated the Kuaizhou 1A version 
            on 9 January 2017, from Jiuquan. It placed three small satellites 
            into a polar orbit.

            The Long March 1 (长征一号), also known as the Changzheng-1 
            (CZ-1), was the first member of China's Long March rocket family.

            Development started in January 1965 after the Seventh Ministry 
            of Machinery Industry issued a design task. The two stage 
            liquid fueled DF-4 was modified by adding a third stage in 
            order to make it to the desired orbit. Long March 1's second 
            flight launched China's first satellite, Dong Fang Hong 1, to 
            space on April 24, 1970. The rocket was operational between 
            1970-1971. Wang Xiji was the chief designer of the rocket.

Also known as "Chang Zheng 1-D/CZ-1"

            Long March 1D was a member of China's Long March rocket 
            family. During the 1990s CALT developed an improved 
            version of the DF-4 to test the reentry vehicle warheads 
            of the DF-31. They took advantage of this 
            development and offered it as the Long March 1D for 
            commercial application. The modifications included:

            An DF-4 improved first stage, which used the new version 
            of the YF-2B, and switched propellants to UDMH/N2O4 for 
            improved performance. The replacement of the DF-4 second 
            stage motor YF-3A. The proposed replacement was the Long 
            March 4 third stage engine, the YF-40. A new inline 
            inter-stage would replace the existing tapered connector 
            between the second and third stages, which allowed for an 
            additional 70cm diameter to be added to the third stage 
            skirt. This would allow for the addition of RCS to the 
            third stage. A new third stage with a new motor, the FG-36 
            and an optional RCS. A new computer inertial guidance system 
            which enabled the third stage to be 3-axis stabilised for 
            added precision. The new design did not have a good reception 
            and was only used for reentry vehicle tests. It flew three 
            suborbital missions from Taiyuan LC-1 with two successes and 
            a failure on the final mission. The first launch was on 
            June 1, 1995 and the second one was in November 1997. The 
            final and failed launch was on January 3, 2002.

            Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit 
            medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by 
            SpaceX in the United States. It is powered by Merlin 
            engines, also developed by SpaceX, burning cryogenic 
            liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as 
            propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional 
            Star Wars spacecraft, the Millennium Falcon, and the 
            nine Merlin engines of the rocket's first stage. The rocket 
            evolved with versions v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016), 
            v1.2 "Full Thrust" (2015–present), including the Block 5 
            Full Thrust variant, flying since May 2018. Unlike most 
            rockets, which are expendable launch systems, since the 
            introduction of the Full Thrust version, Falcon 9 is 
            partially reusable, with the first stage capable of 
            re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after 
            separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved 
            for the first time on flight 20 with the v1.2 version in 
            December 2015.

            Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms 
            (50,300 lbs) to low Earth orbit, 8,300 kg (18,300 lbs) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) when expended, and 
            5,500 kg (12,100 lbs) to GTO when the first stage is 
            recovered. The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been 
            Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lbs), and Telstar 19V 
            with 7,075 kg (15,598 lbs). The latter was launched into a 
            lower-energy GTO orbit achieving an apogee well below the 
            geostationary altitude, while the former was launched into 
            an advantageous super-synchronous transfer orbit.

            In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) 
            contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services 
            (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space 
            Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first 
            mission under this contract launched on October 8, 2012. Falcon 
            9 has been human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the 
            ISS as part of the NASA Commercial Crew Development program. 
            Currently, Falcon 9 has been certified for the National Security 
            Space Launch[22] program and NASA Launch Services Program as 
            "Category 3", which can launch the priciest, most important, and 
            most complex NASA missions.

            Five rockets of the version 1.0 design were launched from June 2010 
            to March 2013. Version 1.1 conducted fifteen launches from September 
            2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version was in service from 
            December 2015 into 2018, with several additional upgrades within 
            this version. The latest variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 
            2018. It features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and 
            other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon 
            Heavy derivative, introduced in February 2018, consists of a 
            strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its center core, attached to 
            two standard Falcon 9 first stages used as boosters.

            The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch 
            vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived 
            from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened 
            Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional 
            Falcon 9-like first stages as strap-on boosters. The Falcon 
            Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently 
            operational launch vehicle, the third-highest capacity of 
            any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V and 
            Energia, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class 
            rocket ever launched successfully (behind the Saturn V and 
            Energia).

            SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 
            2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC). The rocket carried a Tesla
            Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, carrying a dummy 
            dubbed "Starman", as a dummy payload. The second Falcon Heavy 
            launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets 
            successfully returned to earth.[10] The third Falcon Heavy launch 
            successfully occurred on June 25, 2019. Since then, the Falcon 
            Heavy has been certified for the National Security Space Launch 
            program.

            The Falcon Heavy was designed to be able to carry humans into space 
            beyond low Earth orbit, although as of February 2018, SpaceX has 
            confirmed that they will not transport people on the Falcon Heavy, 
            nor pursue the human-rating certification process to transport NASA 
            astronauts. The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the 
            Starship launch system.

            stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine manufactured by 
            RD Amross and burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The Centaur 
            upper stage is powered by one or two US RL10 engine(s) 
            manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne and burning liquid 
            hydrogen and liquid oxygen. AJ-60A strap-on solid rocket 
            boosters (SRBs) are used in some configurations and will 
            be replaced by GEM-63 SRBs in the near future. The standard 
            payload fairings are 4 or 5 meters in diameter with various
            lengths.

            The Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch 
            Services (LMCLS) as part of the US Air Force Evolved Expendable 
            Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and made its inaugural flight on 
            August 21, 2002. The vehicle operates from Space Launch Complex 
            41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Space Launch Complex 
            3-E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LMCLS continued to market the 
            Atlas V to commercial customers worldwide until January 2018, 
            when ULA assumed control of commercial marketing and sales.

            The Space Launch System (SLS) is a super heavy-lift expendable 
            launch vehicle, which has been under development by NASA in the 
            United States since its announcement in 2011. It is the primary 
            launch vehicle of NASA's deep space exploration plans, including 
            the planned crewed lunar flights of the Artemis program and a 
            possible follow-on human mission to Mars. The SLS program has 
            replaced the Constellation program's Ares V launch vehicle program
            of 2005, which never left the development phase. SLS is intended 
            to replace the retired Space Shuttle as NASA's flagship vehicle. 
            Following the cancelation of the Constellation program, the NASA 
            Authorization Act of 2010 envisioned a single launch vehicle usable 
            for both crew and cargo. In 2013, SLS was projected to possibly be 
            the most capable super-heavy lift vehicle ever built.

            The initial variant of SLS, Block 1, was required by the US Congress 
            to lift a payload of 70 tonnes (69 long tons; 77 short tons) to low 
            Earth orbit (LEO), but it was later planned to exceed that requirement 
            with a rated payload capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons; 105 short 
            tons). As of 22 December 2019, this variant is planned to launch 
            Artemis 1, Artemis 2, Artemis 3, and Europa Clipper. The later Block 
            1B is intended to debut the Exploration Upper Stage and launch the 
            notional Artemis 4 through Artemis 7. Block 2 is planned to replace 
            the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and would 
            have a LEO capability of more than 130 tonnes (130 long tons; 140 short 
            tons), again as required by Congress.[ Block 2 is intended to enable 
            crewed launches to Mars. SLS is to have the world's highest-ever 
            total thrust at launch, but not the world's highest ever payload 
            mass. The SLS is planned to launch the Orion spacecraft and use the 
            ground operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center 
            in Florida.

--Vehicle description--
The SLS is a Space Shuttle-derived launch vehicle, with the first stage of the rocket being powered by one central core stage and two outboard boosters. The upper stage is being developed from the Block 1 variant to a Block 2 variant, the Exploration Upper Stage.

-Core stage-
The Space Launch System's core stage contains the Main Propulsion System (MPS) of the rocket. It is 65 metres (212 ft) long by 8.4 metres (27.6 ft) in diameter and fuels the four RS-25 rocket engines at its base. The core stage is structurally and visually similar to the Space Shuttle external tank, containing the liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. Initial flights are planned to use modified RS-25D engines left over from the Space Shuttle program. However, Space Shuttle main engines are reusable, so later flights are planned to switch to a different version of the engine not designed for reuse, as it will be cheaper.

The core stage is fabricated at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility and is common across all currently planned evolutions of the SLS to avoid the need for redesigns to meet varying requirements.

-Boosters-
SLS Booster test at Orbital ATK/Northrop Grumman's desert facility northwest of Ogden, Utah, March 2015
Block 1 and 1B boosters
Blocks 1 and 1B of the SLS are planned to use two five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). These new SRBs are derived from the four-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, with the addition of a center booster segment, new avionics, and lighter insulation. The five-segment SRBs provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the Shuttle SRB, but will no longer be recovered after use.

-Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension program-
The stock of SLS boosters is limited by the number of casings left over from the Shuttle program, since they modify flown boosters to add an additional segment. There are enough to last through eight flights of the SLS, but a replacement will be required for further flights. On 2 March 2019, the Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) program was announced. This program will use new solid rocket boosters built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems for further SLS flights. These boosters would be derived from the composite-casing SRBs in development for the OmegA launch vehicle, and are projected to increase Block 1B's payload to TLI by 3–4 tonnes, which is still 1 ton below the payload capacity of Block 2.

-Upper Stage-
ICPS - Block 1
The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) is planned to fly on Artemis 1. It is a stretched and human rated Delta IV 5 metres (16 ft) Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) powered by a single RL10B-2. Block 1 is intended to be capable of lifting 95 tonnes to LEO in this configuration if the ICPS is considered part of the payload. Artemis 1 is to be launched into an initial 1,800 by −93 kilometres (1,118 by −58 mi) suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. ICPS will then perform an orbital insertion burn at apogee and a subsequent translunar injection burn to send Orion towards the moon. The ICPS for Artemis 1 was delivered by ULA to NASA about July 2017, and was housed at Kennedy Space Centre as of November 2018. As of February 2020, ICPS (not EUS) is planned for Artemis 1, 2, and 3. ICPS will now be human-rated for the crewed Artemis-2 flight.

EUS - Block 1B and 2
The Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) is planned to fly on Artemis 4. Similar to the S-IVB, the EUS will complete the SLS ascent phase and then re-ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. It is expected to be used by Block 1B and Block 2, share the core stage diameter of 8.4 meters, and be powered by four RL10 engines.

--Program History--
During the joint Senate-NASA presentation in September 2011, it was stated that the SLS program had a projected development cost of US$18 billion through 2017, with US$10 billion for the SLS rocket, US$6 billion for the Orion spacecraft and US$2 billion for upgrades to the launch pad and other facilities at Kennedy Space Center. These costs and schedule were considered optimistic in an independent 2011 cost assessment report by Booz Allen Hamilton for NASA.

An internal 2011 NASA document estimated the cost of the program through 2025 to total at least $41 billion for four 95-tonne launches (1 uncrewed, 3 crewed), with the 130-tonne version ready no earlier than 2030.

The Human Exploration Framework Team (HEFT) estimated unit costs for Block 0 at US$1.6 billion and Block 1 at US$1.86 billion in 2010. However, since these estimates were made the Block 0 SLS vehicle was dropped in late 2011, and the design was not completed.

In September 2012, an SLS deputy project manager stated that US$500 million per launch is a reasonable target cost[clarification needed] for SLS.

In 2013, the Space Review estimated the cost per launch at US$5 billion, depending on the rate of launches. NASA announced in 2013 that the European Space Agency will build the Orion service module.

In 2011, NASA announced an "Advanced Booster Competition", to be decided in 2015, which would select whose boosters would be used for Block 2 of the SLS.

Several companies proposed boosters for this competition:

Aerojet, in partnership with Teledyne Brown, offered a booster powered by three new AJ1E6 LOX/RP-1 oxidizer-rich staged combustion engines, each producing 4,900 kN (1,100,000 lbf) thrust using a single turbopump to supply dual combustion chambers. On 14 February 2013, Aerojet was awarded a $23.3 million, 30-month contract to build a 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) main injector and thrust chamber.
Alliant Techsystems (ATK) proposed an advanced SRB nicknamed "Dark Knight", which would switch to a lighter composite case, use a more energetic propellant, and reduce the number of segments from five to four.
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Dynetics proposed a liquid-fueled booster named Pyrios.
In 2013, the manager of NASA's SLS advanced development office indicated that all three approaches were viable.

However, this competition was planned for a development plan in which Block 1A would be followed by Block 2A, with upgraded boosters. NASA canceled Block 1A and the planned competition in April 2014. Due to this cancellation, it was reported in February 2015 that SLS is expected to fly with the original five-segment SRB until at least the late 2020s. This decision was vindicated as a later study found that the advanced booster would have resulted in unsuitably high acceleration. The overly powerful booster would need modifications to Launch Pad 39B, its flame trench, and Mobile Launcher, which are being evaluated.

In August 2014, as the SLS program passed its Key Decision Point C review and entered full development, costs from February 2014 until its planned launch in September 2018 were estimated at US$7.021 billion. Ground systems modifications and construction would require an additional US$1.8 billion over the same time period.

In October 2018, NASA's inspector general reported that the Boeing core stage contract had made up 40% of the US$11.9 billion spent on SLS as of August 2018. By 2021, core stages were expected to have cost a total of US$8.9 billion, which is twice the initial planned amount.

In December 2018, NASA estimated that yearly budgets for SLS will range from US$2.1 to US$2.3 billion between 2019 and 2023.

In March 2019, the Trump Administration released its Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request for NASA. This budget did not include any money for the Block 1B and Block 2 variants of SLS. It was therefore uncertain whether these future variants of SLS will be developed, but congressional action restored this funding in the passed budget. Several launches previously planned for the SLS Block 1B are now expected to fly on commercial launcher vehicles such as Falcon Heavy, New Glenn, OmegA, and Vulcan. However, the request for a budget increase of US$1.6 billion towards SLS, Orion, and crewed landers along with the launch manifest seem to indicate support of the development of Block 1B, debuting Artemis 3. The Block 1B will be used mainly for co-manifested crew transfers and logistical needs rather than constructing the Gateway. An uncrewed Block 1B is planned to launch the Lunar Surface Asset in 2028, the first lunar outpost of the Artemis program. Block 2 development will most likely start in the late 2020s, after NASA is regularly visiting the lunar surface and shifts focus towards Mars.

In May 2019, NASA's Office of Audits reported that the SLS Block 1's marginal cost per launch is to be at least US$876 million. By comparison, a Saturn V launch cost roughly $1.23 billion in 2016 dollars. A letter from the White House to the Senate Appropriations Committee revealed that the SLS's cost per launch is estimated at "over US$2 billion" after development. NASA did not deny this cost and an agency spokesperson stated it "is working to bring down the cost of a single SLS launch in a given year as the agency continues negotiations with Boeing on the long-term production contract and efforts to finalize contracts and costs for other elements of the rocket".

Blue Origin submitted a proposal to replace the Exploration Upper Stage with an alternative to be designed and fabricated by the company, but it was rejected by NASA in November 2019 on multiple grounds. These included lower performance compared to the existing EUS design, unsuitability of the proposal to current ground infrastructure, and unacceptable acceleration in regards to Orion components.

            New Glenn, named after John Glenn, is a heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle 
            in development by Blue Origin. Design work on the vehicle began in 2012. 
            Illustrations of the vehicle, and the high-level specifications, were 
            initially publicly unveiled in September 2016. New Glenn is described as 
            a two-stage rocket with a diameter of 7 meters (23 ft). Its first stage 
            will be powered by seven BE-4 engines that are also being designed and 
            manufactured by Blue Origin.

            Like the New Shepard suborbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the 
            New Glenn's first stage is designed to be reusable. Originally intended 
            for first launch in 2020, by 2018 Blue Origin expected to launch New 
            Glenn in 2021, which remains the current target.

            After initiating the development of an orbital rocket system prior to 
            2012, and stating in 2013 on their website that the first stage would do 
            a powered vertical landing and be reusable, Blue Origin publicly announced 
            their orbital launch vehicle intentions in September 2015. In January 2016, 
            Blue Origin indicated that the new rocket would be many times larger than 
            New Shepard even though it would be the smallest of the family of Blue Origin 
            orbital vehicles. Blue Origin publicly released the high-level design of 
            the vehicle—and announced the name New Glenn—in September 2016.

            H-IIA (H-2A) is an active expendable launch system operated by Mitsubishi 
            Heavy Industries (MHI) for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. These liquid 
            fuel rockets have been used to launch satellites into geostationary orbit; lunar 
            orbiting spacecraft; Akatsuki, which studied the planet Venus; and the Emirates 
            Mars Mission, which was launched to Mars in July 2020. Launches occur at the 
            Tanegashima Space Center. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. As of July 2020, H-IIA 
            rockets were launched 42 times, including 36 consecutive missions without a 
            failure, dating back to 29 November 2003.

            Production and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on 1 April 2007. 
            Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter SELENE, was the first H-IIA launched 
            after this privatization.

            The H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier H-II rocket, substantially redesigned to 
            improve reliability and minimize costs. There have been four variants, with two 
            in active service (as of 2020) for various purposes. A derivative design, the H-IIB, 
            was developed in the 2000s and made its maiden flight in 2009.

            The Diamant rocket (Diamant is French for "diamond") was the 
            first exclusively French expendable launch system and at the 
            same time the first satellite launcher not built by either 
            the United States or USSR. As such, it has been referred to 
            as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher 
            projects.

            During 1962, development of the Diamant commenced as the 
            inaugural spacecraft project of France's space agency, the Centre 
            National d'Études Spatiales (CNES). As a project, it was derived 
            from the military program Pierres précieuses (fr.: gemstones) that 
            included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis and 
            Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire), and drew heavily 
            upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously 
            developed. On 26 November 1965, the Diamant A performed its maiden 
            flight. Out of a total of 12 aunch attempts to be performed between 
            1965 and 1975, 9 of these were successful. Most notably, on 26 November 
            1965, the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French 
            satellite, named Astérix.

            Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed, 
            designated A, B and BP4. All versions had three stages and a 
            payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit. Despite the 
            success of the Diamant as a launcher, France ultimately chose to 
            terminate further work on its national launcher program in favor 
            of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what 
            would become the Ariane launcher in 1975.

            OTRAG (German: Orbital Transport und Raketen AG, or Orbital Transport 
            nd Rockets, Inc.), was a German company based in Stuttgart, which in 
            the late 1970s and early 1980s planned to develop an alternative 
            propulsion system for rockets. OTRAG was the first commercial developer 
            and producer of space launch vehicles. The OTRAG Rocket claimed to 
            present an inexpensive alternative to existing launch systems through 
            mass-production of Common Rocket Propulsion Units (CRPU).

            OTRAG was founded in 1975 by the German aerospace engineer Lutz Kayser. 
            OTRAG's goal was to develop, produce, and operate a low cost satellite 
            launch vehicle. It was the first private company to attempt to launch a 
            private spacecraft. The OTRAG rocket was intended to be an inexpensive 
            alternative to the European rocket Ariane and the NASA Space Shuttle. 
            Kayser and a private consortium of six hundred European investors 
            financed the development and production of the OTRAG satellite launch 
            vehicle. Dr. Kurt H. Debus served as Chairman of the Board of OTRAG after 
            his retirement as director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and Dr. 
            Wernher von Braun served as scientific adviser to Kayser.

            In the face of doubts by Debus and von Braun, Kayser chose in 1975 to set 
            up testing and launch facilities in Shaba, Zaire (now Katanga Province in 
            the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Debus and von Braun were concerned 
            about the possibility of Zairian acquisition of missile technology from 
            the facilities. Kayser decided to proceed despite their opposition.

            Otrag's first test was on May 17, 1977, with the second successful launch 
            on May 20, 1978. The third test failed on June 5, with Zairian President 
            Mobutu Sese Seko watching the launch.

            Political pressure to halt the company's operations mounted quickly. 
            France and the Soviet Union were historically opposed to German 
            long-distance rocket development, and pressured the Zairian government 
            into closing down the development facility in 1979. Immediately afterwards, 
            Presidents Giscard d'Estaing of France and Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet 
            Union convinced the West German government to cancel the OTRAG project and 
            close down its German operations. In 1980, OTRAG moved its production and 
            testing facilities to a desert site in Libya. A series of successful tests 
            were conducted at this site beginning in 1981.

            OTRAG shut down in 1987. As the company left Libya, Muammar Gaddafi 
            confiscated all equipment and installations, hoping to later use the 
            technology, and German investors lost their money.

Design:

Various OTRAG rockets could be built up from the company's CRPUs (Common Rocket Propulsion Unit). A sounding rocket would bundle four or more CRPUs in parallel, topped with the payload. An orbital launcher would use dozens to hundreds of CRPUs, depending on payload mass. The launcher would then stage by dropping outer CRPUs, leaving the interior ones to continue with payload.

A CRPU was essentially a steel tube, 27 cm in diameter and 16 meters long, joined from a few shorter tubes. The CRPU was divided into three sections by aluminium bulkheads, with additional stiffening rings between bulkheads. Forward, the majority of the tube contained a mixture of nitric acid and nitrogen tetroxide oxidisers. Next was a section of kerosene fuel. This was commercial-grade kerosene, not the more expensive RP-1. Last was the engine section. A fuel line carried nitric acid around the kerosene, into the engine.

The design of the CRPU was extremely simple. The tubing was strong enough that the propellants were fed to the engine by pressure alone.
 This eliminated the need for turbopumps. The engine was ablatively cooled, eliminating the need for fine fuel passages and heat-resistant kerosene. The engine did not gimbal; instead, the vehicle was steered by throttling one side's CRPUs versus the opposite side. Thus, the engine was simply built into the tube walls, with the only mechanisms being the throttling valves. No separate pressurising system was included; the tanks were simply left with an ullage space, which was then filled with gas to a few hundred psi. Because of the narrow tubing, the bulkheads between sections could be simple plates, instead of domes like virtually all other rocket stages. There was no ignition system; instead, a slug of furfuryl alcohol was injected before the kerosene. The furfuryl alcohol ignited spontaneously upon contact with the nitric acid.

The use of ablative cooling, high-pressure steel construction, and large "empty" spaces meant that a CRPU was heavy, with relatively low performance. The diameter of the tubing also put a hard limit on the engine diameter, preventing use of an efficient, high-expansion nozzle for the upper stages. However, ganging CRPUs into three stages was sufficient to reach orbit. Meanwhile, the low cost of each CRPU, after the economies of scale gained by producing hundreds or possibly thousands of them per year, would have still left the vehicle cheaper than its contemporaries.

The company's baseline launcher design claimed to lift one metric ton to orbit. It would have consisted of a third stage core of four CRPUs, surrounded by a second stage of twelve CRPUs, in turn surrounded by the first stage's 48 CRPUs.
 Larger vehicles and capacities would be achieved with greater numbers of CRPUs, possibly including several hundred per flight for a heavy launcher.

The company forecast that CRPUs would eventually be so cheap, recovering and refurbishing a launcher would be no better than simply building more units.
The use of storable propellants and few moving parts meant that launch-site operations would also be very simple. These advantages were expected to overcome the disadvantages of small specific impulse and payload fraction.

Flight History:

The engines were tested extensively on ground rigs, on both German and African test sites. Experiments were run with varying fuel and oxidiser formulations, as the general design was quite robust.

Small, 4-unit vehicles were built and tested in Shaba North, Zaire and Seba Oasis, Libya, where heights of 20 to 50 kilometres were reached. The rockets used there were 6 and 12 meters long. The basic CRPU concept was shown to be workable, though some rockets experienced guidance or component failures. The last launch of an OTRAG rocket took place on September 19, 1983 in Esrange. Following this launch, the OTRAG rocket was to be used in high altitude research.

Political pressure then shut down the project, as discussed in the OTRAG article.

After the company had left Libya in 1987, some remaining equipment was confiscated by the government. However, enough parts and knowledge were missing to prevent Libya from continuing the project.

            The M-4S rocket (MU4S rocket) was developed by the Institute of Aeronautics 
            and Astronautics of the University of Tokyo (hereinafter referred to as the 
            University of Tokyo) jointly with the Nissan Motor Aerospace Division 
            (hereinafter referred to as the Nissan), manufactured by Nissan, and 
            operated by the University of Tokyo. It is a solid fuel rocket . 4 units 
            were launched from Uchinoura Space Center and 3 units succeeded. This 
            section also describes M-1, M-3D, which is a full-scale preliminary test 
            machine for M-4S.

            It was developed based on the technology of the L-4S rocket . All stages 
            consist of solid-fuel rockets that do not have a guidance device, and 
            carry out satellite orbit injection by the gravity turn method . Due to 
            the relationship with the launch launcher, the tail can not be installed 
            in the second stage, and after launch, the flare that opens like an 
            umbrella at the rear end of the second stage stabilizes the posture. 
            The tail area of the first stage is also smaller than that of 
            the L-4S relative to the rocket body. For this reason, the flight 
            stability is lower than that of the L-4S, but the probability of 
            satellite orbit injection can be secured by optimizing the orbit design 
            based on the thrust margin. Basically, each satellite of M-4S was 
            launched as a "target orbit" with all satellites near 700 km perigee 
            and 2500-4500 km apogee (apogee changes significantly depending on 
            satellite weight) (in this orbit) , Satellite orbits are most likely 
            to be established, even if swept by the wind, exceeding 95%). This is 
            the reason why the weights of all the satellites that are thrown in 
            are less than half of the low-orbit launch capability in the catalog.

            The first unit was launched on September 25, 1970 (Showa 45) , but 
            failed to put the satellite into orbit. Unit 4 from Unit 2 , 1971 
            in February from 1972 August was launched.

            Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), which was the precursor to the 
            European Space Agency (ESA). It was developed with the aim to delivering 
            space access technology, and more specifically to facilitate the 
            deployment of European-wide telecommunication and meteorological satellites 
            into orbit.

            The Blue Streak missile predated the Europa programme, having originally 
            been developed by Britain primarily for military purposes, however it was 
            cancelled in 1960. Efforts to repurpose the Blue Streak, such as the studied 
            Black Prince expendable launch system, eventually cumulated in the 
            multinational Europa programme.

            Workshare on the programme was shared between the various members of the ELDO 
            based upon their financial contributions. The Europa launcher itself 
            primarily consisted of the Blue Streak, Coralie, and Astris rocket stages.

            The programme proceeded to perform multiple test launches, however these 
            frequently resulted in partial failures. In addition, Britain decided to 
            pull out of the ELDO organisation, and thus Europa, to instead focus on 
            the rival British Black Arrow launcher instead. This led to the replacement 
            of the Blue Streak by the French-built Diamant section. However, confidence 
            in the programme had diminished due to the poor reliability figures, and this 
            led to its termination. While Europa was ultimately cancelled, the ambition 
            for such a launcher was still present and supported by the majority of ELDO 
            members and, following its reformation into the ESA in 1974, the agency 
            proceeded to develop the Ariane family of launchers, would which prove to be 
            a commercial success with hundreds of launches performed.

            Hermes was a proposed spaceplane designed by the French Centre National d'Études 
            Spatiales (CNES) in 1975, and later by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was 
            superficially similar to the American Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar and the larger Space 
            Shuttle.

            In January 1985, CNES proposed to proceed with Hermes development under the 
            auspices of the ESA. Hermes was to have been part of a crewed spaceflight 
            program. It would have been launched using an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. In November 
            1987, the project was approved; it was to commence an initial pre-development phase 
            from 1988 to 1990, after which the authorisation to proceed to full-rate development 
            was to depend on the outcome of this phase. However, the project was subject to 
            numerous delays and funding issues around this period.
            
            In 1992, Hermes was cancelled. This was in part due to unachievable cost and 
            performance goals, as well as the formation of a partnership with the Russian 
            Aviation and Space Agency (RKA), which reduced the demand for an independent crewed 
            spaceplane. As a result, no Hermes shuttles were ever built. During the 2010s, it was 
            proposed to relaunch the Hermes vehicle to serve as a partially reusable air-launched 
            spaceplane launch system, known as SOAR.

            Vega (Italian: Vettore Europeo di Generazione Avanzata, meaning "Advanced generation 
            European carrier rocket"), is an expendable launch system in use by Arianespace 
            jointly developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the European Space Agency 
            (ESA). Development began in 1998 and the first launch took place from the Centre 
            Spatial Guyanais on 13 February 2012.

            It is designed to launch small payloads — 300 to 2500 kg satellites for scientific 
            and Earth observation missions to polar and low Earth orbits. The reference Vega 
            mission is a polar orbit bringing a spacecraft of 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km.
            
            The rocket, named after Vega, the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, is a 
            single-body launcher (no strap-on boosters) with three solid rocket stages: the P80 
            first stage, the Zefiro 23 second stage, and the Zefiro 9 third stage. The upper 
            module is a liquid rocket called AVUM. The improved version of the P80 stage, the 
            P120C, will be used as the side boosters of the Ariane 6. Italy is the leading 
            contributor to the Vega program (65%), followed by France (13%). Other participants 
            include Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.
            
            During the mid-1990s, French firms Aérospatiale and SEP, along with Italian firm 
            Bombrini-Parodi-Delfino (BPD), commenced discussions on the development of a proposed 
            Ariane Complementary Launcher (ACL). Around the same time, Italy began to champion the 
            concept of a new solid-propellant satellite launcher. This proposed launcher, dubbed 
            Vega, was promoted as functioning to expand the range of European launch capabilities; 
            Vega would be capable of launching a 1000 kg payload capability into a 700 km polar 
            orbit. From the onset, the first of three stages would be based on the solid booster 
            of the existing Ariane 5 expendable launch system while the second and third stages 
            would make use of the in-development Zefiro rocket motor.

            However, it was recognised to be a costly project and thus difficult for Italy alone 
            to finance; accordingly, international partners were sought early on in order to 
            proceed with development. In April 1998, it was publicly stated that the Vega 
            programme was dependent upon the securing of roughly ECU70 million of industrial 
            investment, as well as the availability of around ECU350 million of funding that 
            had been requested from interested member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), 
            led by France and Italy. During June 1998, it was announced that ministers from 
            European Space Agency (ESA) member states had agreed to proceed with the first phase 
            of the development programme for Vega; the participating members were France, Belgium, 
            the Netherlands, Spain and Italy - the latter had assumed 55% of the burden for 
            financing the programme.
            
            By September 1998, it was projected that, if fully funded, Vega would perform its first 
            launch during 2002. However, by early 1998, France was publicly showing displeasure in 
            the programme, leading to disputes in its funding. A new, higher-performance version of 
            the Vega was proposed, but this failed to sufficiently satisfy France. In September 1999, 
            France decided to withdraw from the Vega programme entirely, leading to fears for the 
            future of the launcher. In November 1999, European Space Agency (ESA) formally dropped 
            Vega as an endorsed programme, a decision which was largely attributed to France's 
            withdrawal; Italy declared that it would proceed regardless, and threatened to re-direct 
            its allocated contributions for the further development of the Ariane 5 to meet the 
            shortfall.
            
            Around 2000, an alternative use for the Vega was explored as a medium-class booster rocket 
            to be used in conjunction with an improved, up-rated model of the Ariane 5 heavy launcher. 
            In October 2000, it was announced that France and Italy had settled their year-long 
            dispute over the Vega programme; France and Italy agreed to provide 35% and 52%, respectively, 
            of the financing towards the all-composite P80 booster for the Ariane 5 — work which would be 
            included in the Vega programme. In March 2001, FiatAvio and the Italian Space Agency formed 
            a new company, European Launch Vehicle (ELV), to assume responsibility for the majority of 
            development work on the Vega programme. By 2003, there was concerns that European Space 
            Agency (ESA)'s recent adoption of the Russian Soyuz launcher would directly compete with the 
            in-development Vega; demands for such launchers had declined with a downturn in the mobile 
            telecommunications satellite market and doubts over the European Galileo satellite 
            navigation system.

            The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV is a Small-lift launch vehicle, was a project 
            started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organisation to develop 
            the technology needed to launch satellites. SLV was intended to reach a height 
            of 400 kilometres (250 mi) and carry a payload of 40 kg (88 lbs). The first 
            experimental flight of SLV-3, in August 1979, was a failure. The first successful 
            launch took place on 18 July, 1980.

            It was a four-stage rocket with all solid-propellant motors.
            
            The first launch of the SLV took place in Sriharikota on 10 August 1979. The 
            fourth and final launch of the SLV took place on 17 April 1983.
            
            It has taken approximately seven years to realise the vehicle from start. The 
            solid motor case for first and second stage are fabricated from 15 CDV6 steel 
            sheets and third and fourth stages from fibre reinforced plastic.
            
            All four SLV launches occurred from the SLV Launch Pad at the Sriharikota High 
            Altitude Range. The first two launches were experimental (E) and the next 2 
            were designated as developmental (D) as this was the first launch vehicle 
            being developed by India not intended for a long service life.

            The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle or Advanced Satellite Launch Vehicle, also 
            known as ASLV, was a Small-lift launch vehicle five-stage solid-fuel rocket 
            developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to place 150 kg 
            satellites into LEO. This project was started by India during the early 1980s to 
            develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. 
            Its design was based on Satellite Launch Vehicle. ISRO did not have sufficient 
            funds for both the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle programme and the ASLV programme 
            at the same time and the ASLV programme was terminated after the initial 
            developmental flights. The payloads of ASLV were Stretched Rohini Satellites.
            
            The ASLV was a five-stage vehicle. Two strap-on boosters acted as a first stage, 
            with the core stage igniting after booster burn out. The payload capacity of the 
            ASLV was approximately 150 kg (330 lbs) to an orbit of 400 km (250 mi) with a 
            47-degree inclination.

            At liftoff, the ASLV generated 909.9 kN (204,500 lbsf) of thrust. It was a 
            41,000-kilogram (90,000 lbs) rocket, measuring 23.5 metres (77 ft) in length with 
            a core diameter of one metre (3 ft 3 in).[4] The height to diameter ratio of ASLV 
            was very large which resulted in the vehicle being unstable in flight. This was 
            compounded by the fact that many of the critical events during a launch like the 
            core ignition and the booster separation happened at the Tropopause where the 
            dynamic loads on the launcher was at the maximum.
            
            The ASLV made four launches, of which one was successful, two failed to achieve 
            orbit, and a third achieved a lower than planned orbit which decayed quickly. 
            The type made its maiden flight on 24 March 1987, and its final flight on 4 May 1994.

                                -Variants-
            ISRO has envisaged a number of variants of PSLV to cater to different mission 
            requirements. There are currently two operational versions of the PSLV — the 
            core-alone (PSLV-CA) without strap-on motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, with 
            six extended length (XL) strap-on motors carrying 12 tonnes of HTPB based 
            propellant each. These configurations provide wide variations in payload 
            capabilities up to 3,800 kg (8,400 lbs) in LEO and 1,800 kg (4,000 lbs) in 
            sun-synchronous orbit.
            
            PSLV-G (retired)
            The standard or "Generic" version of the PSLV, PSLV-G had four stages using 
            solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six strap-on motors 
            (PSOM or S9) with 9 tonne propellant loading. It had capability to launch 
            1,678 kg (3,699 lbs) to 622 km (386 mi) into sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C35
            was the last operational launch of PSLV-G before its discontinuation.
            
            PSLV-CA
            The PSLV-CA, CA meaning "Core Alone", model premiered on 23 April 2007. The 
            CA model does not include the six strap-on boosters used by the PSLV 
            standard variant but two SITVC tanks with Roll Control Thruster modules are 
            still attached to the side of the first stage with addition of two cylindrical 
            aerodynamic stabilizers. The fourth stage of the CA variant has 400 kg (880 lbs) 
            less propellant when compared to its standard version. It currently has 
            capability to launch 1,100 kg (2,400 lbs) to 622 km (386 mi) Sun synchronous 
            orbit.
            
            PSLV-XL
            PSLV-XL is the upgraded version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its 
            standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters
            with 12 tonne propellant load. Weighing 320 t (710,000 lbs) at lift-off, the 
            vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL or S12) to achieve higher payload 
            capability. On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version 
            of strap-on booster for the PSLV. The first use of PSLV-XL was the launch of 
            Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV C11. The payload capability for this variant is 1,800 kg 
            (4,000 lbs) to SSO.
            
            PSLV-DL
            PSLV-DL variant has only two strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load on 
            them. PSLV-C44 on 24 January 2019 was the first flight to use PSLV-DL variant of 
            Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
            
            PSLV-QL
            PSLV-QL variant has four ground-lit strap-on boosters, each with 12 tonnes of 
            propellant. PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first flight of PSLV-QL.
            
            
            PSLV C45 lift off (Concept)
            PSLV-3S was conceived as a three-staged version of PSLV with its six strap-on 
            boosters and second liquid stage removed. The total lift-off mass of PSLV-3S was 
            expected to be 175 tonnes with capacity to place 500 kg in 550 km low Earth orbit.

            Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is an expendable launch system 
            operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). GSLV was used in 
            thirteen launches from 2001 to 2018, with more launches planned. Even though
            GSLV Mk III shares the name, it is an entirely different launcher.

            The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) project was initiated in 
            1990 with the objective of acquiring an Indian launch capability for 
            geosynchronous satellites.

            GSLV uses major components that are already proven in the Polar Satellite 
            Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launchers in the form of the S125/S139 solid rocket 
            booster and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine. Due to the thrust required for 
            injecting the satellite in a GTO orbit the third stage was to be powered by a 
            LOX/LH2 Cryogenic engine which at that time India did not possess or had the 
            technology know-how to build one.

            The first development flight of the GSLV (Mk.I configuration) was launched on 
            18 April 2001 was a failure as the payload failed to reach the intended orbit 
            parameters. The launcher was declared operational after the second development 
            flight successfully launched the GSAT-2 satellite. During the initial years 
            from the initial launch to 2014 the launcher had a checkered history with 
            only 2 successful launches out of 7.

            Cryogenic Engine Controversy
            The third stage was to be procured from Russian company Glavcosmos, including 
            transfer of technology and design details of the engine based on an agreement 
            signed in 1991. Russia backed out of the deal after US objected to the deal 
            as in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) May 1992. As a 
            result, ISRO initiated the Cryogenic Upper Stage Project in April 1994 and 
            began developing its own cryogenic engine. A new agreement was signed with 
            Russia for 7 KVD-1 cryogenic stages and 1 ground mock-up stage with no technology 
            transfer, instead of 5 cryogenic stages along with the technology and design as 
            per the earlier agreement. These engines were used for the initial flights 
            and were named GSLV Mk.1.

            DIRECT was a late-2000s proposed alternative super heavy lift launch vehicle 
            architecture supporting NASA's Vision for Space Exploration that would replace 
            the space agency's planned Ares I and Ares V rockets with a family of Shuttle-
            Derived Launch Vehicles named "Jupiter".

            DIRECT was advocated by a group of space enthusiasts who asserted that they 
            represented a broader team of dozens of NASA and space industry engineers who 
            actively worked on the proposal on an anonymous, voluntary basis in their spare 
            time. In September 2008, the DIRECT Team was said to consist of 69 members, 62 
            of whom were NASA engineers, NASA-contractor engineers, and managers from the 
            Constellation Program. The small number of non-NASA members of the team 
            publicly represented the group.

            The project name "DIRECT" referred to a philosophy of maximizing the re-use of 
            hardware and facilities already in place for the Space Shuttle program (STS), 
            hence a "direct" transition. The DIRECT Team asserted that using this approach 
            to develop and operate a family of high-commonality rockets would reduce costs
            and the gap between retirement of the Space Shuttle and the first launch of 
            Orion, shorten schedules, and simplify technical requirements for future US 
            human space efforts.

            Three major versions of the DIRECT proposal were released with the last, 
            Version 3.0, unveiled in May 2009. On 17 June 2009, the group presented its 
            proposal at a public hearing of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans 
            Committee, a panel reviewing US space efforts, in Washington D.C.

            With the October 11th signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (S. 3729) 
            by President Obama mandating work on the Space Launch System Heavy Lift Launch 
            Vehicle, the DIRECT Team declared their effort a success and disbanded. Some 
            members subsequently announced the formation of a new space technology 
            company: C-Star Aerospace, LLC.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Jupiter Launch Vehicle Family

            DIRECT advocated developing a single, high-commonality family of rockets named 
            Jupiter, adapted closely from existing Space Shuttle systems. Each Jupiter 
            launch vehicle would use a "common core stage" consisting of a tank structure 
            based closely on the existing Space Shuttle External Tank with a pair of 
            standard four-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) mounted at the sides as on 
            the Space Shuttle. Up to four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) from the Space 
            Shuttle Orbiter would be attached to the bottom of the External Tank. The engines 
            would be deorbited along with the expended tank to burn up in the Earth's 
            atmosphere.

            Crews would be carried atop the launch vehicle in NASA's planned Orion Crew 
            Exploration Vehicle, itself topped by the planned Launch Abort System. Cargo, 
            whether carried behind the Orion spacecraft or alone on a cargo-only launch 
            would be enclosed by a payload fairing.

            Many configurations of Jupiter were seen as possible, but the DIRECT version 
            3.0 proposal, released in May 2009, recommended two: the Jupiter-130 and 
            Jupiter-246, with claimed lift capacities exceeding 70 and 110 tonnes, 
            respectively, to low Earth orbit.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Proposed Missions

            Low Earth Orbit and Uncrewed Scientific Missions

            Orion spacecraft taking a Space Shuttle Payload Delivery Module (SSPDM) to the 
            ISS, carrying an airlock, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and other cargo on a 
            single Jupiter-130. DIRECT asserted that the extra payload capability of the 
            Jupiter-130 would allow for a range of additional cargo payloads to be flown 
            with each Orion crew, a capability which is not possible with the Ares I. The 
            team suggested a number of extra missions which would be enabled by Jupiter in 
            their proposal, including:

            -New ISS resupply missions with the three ESA/ASI-built Multi-Purpose Logistics
            Modules
            -Performing more Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions with Orion crews
            -Launching massive new space telescopes over 8 meters in diameter (more than 
            3 times the diameter of Hubble)
            -Perform a Mars Sample Return mission on a single Jupiter launcher, to land 
            on Mars and return a sample of its soil back to Earth for study as early 
            as 2013
            -Launching a human crew to fly around the moon as early as 2013

            The DIRECT team asserted that these additional new missions could have been 
            planned and funded due to development cost savings with the Jupiter rocket 
            family compared to the current NASA baseline. They suggested that the proposed 
            new missions and payloads could provide useful employment for many people who 
            were working in the Space Shuttle program.

            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Origins and History

            DIRECT's Jupiter vehicle would have been an "in-line" Space Shuttle-derived 
            launch vehicle. This broad category of Space Shuttle adaptations, postulated 
            since before the first Shuttle launch, removes the winged Space Shuttle Orbiter, 
            moves the liquid main engines to the bottom of the cryogenic tankage (typically 
            proposed to be adapted from the Shuttle external tank), and relocates the payload 
            to above the tankage.

            The first official study of the concept was conducted in 1986 by NASA's Marshall 
            Space Flight Center in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. It 
            was promoted as one of the alternatives for launching uncrewed cargo and would 
            have potentially allowed a restarted lunar program as well. There were, however, 
            no funds available to NASA for building any new vehicles while the Space Shuttle 
            program continued. The idea was shelved and NASA concentrated on fixing and 
            operating the Space Shuttle instead.

            DIRECT's approach had a resemblance to that of the 1991 National Launch System 
            effort. Proposed jointly by NASA and the Department of Defense as an alternative 
            to the Titan IV, the design was based on the same solid rocket boosters and 
            modified external tank, but instead of the reusable Space Shuttle main engine, 
            specified four of the proposed disposable, less expensive Space Transportation 
            Main Engines. The United States Congress did not appropriate funding for the 
            development. A great deal of reference material exists in the public domain 
            regarding NLS.

            NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) of 2005 included a similar 
            design to the DIRECT proposal using three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME). 
            Known as LV-24 in crew launch form, and LV-25 in cargo configuration, the idea 
            was dismissed because it did not have sufficient performance for the proposed 
            lunar program - however the concept was not considered using an Earth departure 
            stage (EDS).

            DIRECT's re-exploration of the SDLV idea began in 2006 in frustration with the 
            high cost and delays of Ares I and worries that any similar issues with the giant 
            Ares V might put the whole Constellation Program in jeopardy. An additional goal 
            was to maintain US ability to launch crews to space with as short a gap as 
            possible after the planned retirement of Shuttle.

            The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), also referred 
            to as the Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3), is a three-stage medium-lift launch 
            vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Primarily 
            designed to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit,[16] it is 
            also identified as launch vehicle for crewed missions under the Indian Human 
            Spaceflight Programme and dedicated science missions like Chandrayaan-2. The GSLV 
            Mk III has a higher payload capacity than the similarly named GSLV Mk II.

            After several delays and a sub-orbital test flight on 18 December 2014, ISRO 
            successfully conducted the first orbital test launch of GSLV Mk III on 5 June 2017 
            from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Andhra Pradesh.

            In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved ₹43.38 billion (US$610 million) to build 
            10 GSLV Mk III rockets over a five-year period.

            GSLV Mk III launched CARE, India's space capsule recovery experiment module, 
            Chandrayaan-2, India's second lunar mission and will be used to carry Gaganyaan, 
            the first crewed mission under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme.

            ISRO initially planned two launcher families, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle 
            for low Earth orbit and polar launches and the larger Geosynchronous Satellite 
            Launch Vehicle for payloads to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The vehicle 
            was reconceptualized as a more powerful launcher as the ISRO mandate changed. 
            This increase in size allowed the launch of heavier communication and multipurpose 
            satellites, future interplanetary exploration and will be human rated to launch 
            crewed missions. Development of the GSLV Mk III began in the early 2000s, with the 
            first launch planned for 2009–2010. The unsuccessful launch of GSLV D3, due to a 
            failure in the cryogenic upper stage, delayed the GSLV Mk III development program. 
            The GSLV Mk III, while sharing a name with the GSLV, it features different systems 
            and components.

The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (or SSLV) is a small-lift launch vehicle being developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with payload capacity to deliver 500 kg to Low Earth orbit (500 km) or 300 kg to Sun synchronous orbit (500 km) for launching small satellites, with the capability to support multiple orbital drop-offs. On 21 December 2018, the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba completed the design for the vehicle.

The maiden flight is expected in 2020, and all flights will launch from a dedicated launch pad in Sriharikota called Small Satellite Launch Complex (SSLC). A new spaceport, under development, near Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu (as of December 2019) will handle SSLV launches when complete.

After entering the operational phase, the vehicle's production and launch operations will be done by a consortium of Indian firms along with New Space India Limited.

The SSLV was developed with the aim of launching small satellites commercially at drastically reduced price and higher launch rate as compared to PSLV. The manufacturing cost of the SSLV is expected to be ₹30 crore (US$4.2 million) to ₹35 crore (US$4.9 million). 

The projected high launch rate relies on largely autonomous launch operation and on overall simple logistics. To compare, a PSLV launch involves 600 officials while SSLV launch operations would be managed by a small team of about six people. The launch readiness period of the SSLV is expected to be less than a week instead of months. The launch vehicle can be assembled both vertically like the existing PSLV and GSLVs and horizontally like the decommissioned SLV and ASLV.

The first three stages of the vehicle use solid propellant, with a fourth stage being a velocity-trimming module.

RLV-TD is India's first uncrewed flying testbed developed for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration Programme. It is a scaled down prototype of an eventual two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) reusable launch vehicle.

The RLV-TD successfully completed its first atmospheric test flight on 23 May 2016, which lasted for 770 seconds and reached a maximum altitude of 65 kilometres (40 mi). It was designed to evaluate various technologies, and development of the final version is expected to take 10 to 15 years. The fully developed RLV is expected to take off vertically like a rocket, deploy a satellite in orbit, return to Earth, and land on a runway.

RLV-TD was developed by ISRO under the RLV Technology Demonstration Programme. The Technology Demonstration Programme consists of development of hypersonic rocket with air-breathing engines and the reusable launch vehicle.

In January 2012, the design of ISRO's reusable launch vehicle was approved by the "National Review Committee" and clearance was granted to build the vehicle. The vehicle was named "Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator" (RLV-TD). ISRO aims to bring down the cost of payload delivery to low Earth orbit by 80% from existing $20,000/kg to $4,000/kg.

The RLV-TD was developed with an objective to test various aspects such as hypersonic flight, autoland, powered cruise flight, hypersonic flight using the air-breathing engine propulsion and "Hypersonic Experiment". A series of four RLV-TD test flights are planned by ISRO: HEX (Hypersonic Flight Experiment), LEX (Landing Experiment), REX (Return Flight Experiment), and SPEX (Scramjet Propulsion Experiment).

A team of 750 engineers at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, National Aeronautical Laboratory, and Indian Institute of Science worked on the design and development of RLV-TD and the associated rocket. RLV-TD underwent 120 hours of wind tunnel, 5,000 hours of computational fluid dynamics and 1,100 runs of flight simulation tests. RLV-TD has mass of 1.75 tonnes, wingspan of 3.6 meters and overall length of 6.5 meters (excluding the rocket). The vehicle had 600 heat-resistant tiles on its undercarriage and it features delta wings and angled tail fins. Total cost of the project was ₹95 crore (equivalent to ₹110 crore or US$15.4 million in 2019). Future planned developments include testing an air-breathing propulsion system, which aims to capitalise on the oxygen in the atmosphere instead of liquefied oxygen while in flight.


Hypersonic Flight Experiment
RLV-TD HEX-01
The Hypersonic Flight Experiment (HEX), first of the five test flights was conducted on 23 May 2016. The Sub-orbital test flight was launched at 07:00 IST (01:30 GMT) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota (80 kilometres (50 mi) north of Chennai). The test flight lasted for 770 seconds, reached maximum altitude of 65 kilometres (40 mi) and covered a distance of 450 kilometres (280 mi) Sriharikota, steered itself to an on-target splashdown to land (ditch) at a designated spot in the Bay of Bengal. Not designed to float, the vehicle disintegrated on impact with water and was not recovered.

RLV-TD was mounted on top of and launched aboard a single stage solid fuel booster (HS9 booster) that was derived from strap-on boosters flown on India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. By the time, the booster consumed its solid propellant in 91 seconds, the RLV-TD separated from its boost stage and peaked to a sub-orbital altitude of about 65 kilometres (40 mi). The heat shield, guidance, navigation and control algorithms were tested at hypersonic speed by accurately steering the vehicle during the descent stage. For the descent back, the test vehicle was programmed to pitch its nose up, exposing silica tiles on its underside and reinforced carbon–carbon nose cap to the airflow into the thick lower layers of the atmosphere. The RLV-TD endured high temperatures of descent through the atmosphere due to its thermal protection system.

All stages of the test flight were tracked by ground station at the launch site and a shipborne terminal. All the mission objectives were met and technologies like autonomous navigation, guidance and control, reusable thermal protection system and descent mission management were successfully validated.


Future developments
The second experiment in RLV-TD series (LEX) would be an air-drop test where the prototype will be equipped with landing gear to perform an autonomous landing on a runway. The RLV-TD is being designed and built at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. Its navigational equipment was supplied by the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit in Thiruvananthapuram and ISRO's Satellite Applications Centre in Ahmedabad. The RLV-TD's landing gear was supplied by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. ISRO plans to carry out the landing experiment (LEX) on a military runway at Challakere in Chitradurga district. The flight article will be carried to an altitude of 3 km by a helicopter and released to land autonomously at the airstrip. LEX is scheduled for mid 2020.

In other experiments, ISRO intends to carry out an orbital re-entry experiment (REX) and a Scramjet Propulsion Experiment (SPEX) using a reusable carrier vehicle. ISRO Chief K. Sivan stated that the agency had many experiments planned for the RLV-TD, but would only focus on them from 2019, as it was occupied with other missions.

The Unified Launch Vehicle (ULV) is a development project by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) whose core objective is to design a modular architecture that could eventually replace the PSLV, GSLV Mk I/II and GSLV Mk III with a single family of launchers. The design may include a heavy-lift variant dubbed HLV, consisting of the SC-160 stage and two solid rocket boosters, as well as a super heavy-lift variant called SHLV with a cluster stage of five SCE-200 engines . As SCE-200 will only fly after the successful completion of the Gaganyaan program, the launcher will not fly before 2022.

As of May 2013, based on ISRO data, the design comprised a common core and upper stage, with four different booster sizes. All four versions of the boosters are solid motors, with at least three versions reusing current motors from the PSLV, GSLV Mk I/II and LVM3. The core, known as the SC160 (Semi-Cryogenic stage with 160 tonnes of propellant, in the ISRO nomenclature), would have 160,000 kg (350,000 lbs) of Kerosene / LOX propellant and be powered by a single SCE-200 rocket engine. The upper stage, known as the C30 (Cryogenic stage with 30 tonnes of propellant) would have 30,000 kg (66,000 lbs) of LH2 / LOX propellant and be powered by a single CE-20 engine.

The four booster options are:

6 × S-13, slightly larger than the S-12 on PSLV, to burn longer;
2 × S-60, which appears to be a new solid motor development;
2 × S-139, which is the first stage of PSLV and GSLV Mk I/II;
2 × S-200, like on the LVM3.

            Ariane 1 was the first rocket in the Ariane family of expendable launch 
            systems. It was developed and operated by the European Space Agency 
            (ESA), which had been formed in 1973, the same year that development 
            of the launch had commenced.

            Ariane 1 was the first launcher to be developed with the primary 
            purpose of sending commercial satellites into geosynchronous orbit. 
            Crucially, it was designed with the ability of sending a pair of 
            satellites into orbit on a single launcher, thus reducing costs. As 
            the size of satellites grew, Ariane 1 quickly gave way to the more 
            powerful Ariane 2 and Ariane 3 launchers, which were heavily based 
            upon the original rocket. The Ariane 4 was the last rocket to 
            heavily draw upon the Ariane 1, as the successive Ariane 5 having 
            been developed using a far greater level of all-new elements.
            
            In 1973, eleven European countries decided to pursue joint 
            collaboration in the field of space exploration and formed a new 
            pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, the European 
            Space Agency (ESA). For some time prior to the ESA's formation, 
            France had been lobbying for the development of a new European 
            expendable launch system to serve as a replacement for the Europa 
            rocket; one proposed successor in the form of a refined Europa, 
            referred to as the Europa IIIB, was studied but was found to be 
            too ambitious and costly. As a result, the Europa IIIB proposal
            was scaled back and soon reemerged as the L3S. Multinational effort 
            became a quick focus point for the L3S proposal; early on, emphasis
            was placed upon cooperation on the initiative between Germany and 
            France, while increasing contribution from other countries also 
            came into the picture over time.

            In January 1973, Willy Brandt, the Chancellor of Germany, formally 
            agreed to the L3S project following a series of personal approaches 
            by Georges Pompidou, the President of France. On 21 September 1973, 
            the legal agreement for the L3S, was signed. Under this agreement, 
            the Europa III was formally cancelled, while the L3S would be 
            developed as a multinational project. From the onset, the launcher 
            was to be developed for the purpose of sending commercial satellites 
            into geosynchronous orbit, unlike many other competing launchers, 
            which had been typically developed for other purposes and subsequently 
            adapted, such as ballistic missiles. Development of L3S was seen as a 
            crucial test for the ESA, the fortunes of the former being viewed as 
            being highly indicative for the future of the latter. According to 
            author Brian Harvey, L3S was "one of the major European engineering 
            projects in the last quarter of the century".
            
            France was the largest stakeholder in the L3S programme; French 
            aerospace manufacturer Aérospatiale served as the prime contractor 
            and held responsibility for performing the integration of all 
            sections of the vehicle, while French engine manufacturer Société 
            Européenne de Propulsion (SEP) provided both the first and second 
            stage engines (the third stage engines were produced by Air Liquide 
            and German aerospace manufacturer MBB). Other major companies 
            involved included the French electronics firm Matra, Swedish 
            manufacturer Volvo, and German aircraft producer Dornier Flugzeugwerke. 
            The United Kingdom, which held a stake of 2.47 per cent in the project, 
            provided the guidance system, developed by Ferranti, and the central 
            digital computer, from Marconi; British Aerospace had later involvement 
            and workshare as well. Early on, it was felt that the L3S designation 
            lacked public appeal; out of several alternative names, including 
            Phoenix, Lyra, Ganymede and Vega, French minister of industrial and 
            scientific development Jean Charbonnel chose the name Ariane for the 
            new launcher.

            Ariane 2 was an expendable space launch vehicle, operated by the 
            European Space Agency (ESA) between 1986 and 1989 as part of 
            Ariane family of rockets. The principal manufacturer for the 
            Ariane 2 was Aérospatiale, while the lead agency for its 
            development was the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), 
            the French government's space agency.

            Development of the Ariane 2 was authorised in July 1979, months 
            prior to the Ariane 1's first flight. Drawing heavily upon both 
            the design and infrastructure of the Ariane 1, the new launcher 
            was concurrently developed alongside the Ariane 3, with which it 
            shared much of its design. It represented an advancement of the 
            Ariane 1 rather than a replacement, but was capable of lifting
            even heavier payloads into Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). 
            Developed largely within a two year window, the Ariane 2 
            performed its maiden flight on 31 May 1986, actually flying 
            after its Ariane 3 sibling. During its brief service life, the 
            final launch of the Ariane 2 having been conducted on 2 April 
            1989, the Ariane family had become increasingly commercially 
            competitive, becoming the market leading heavy launch vehicle 
            in the world by the late 1980s.
            
            In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in 
            the field of space exploration and formed a new pan-national 
            organisation to undertake this mission, the European Space Agency. 
            Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival of a capable 
            European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 
            1 launcher was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Centre 
            at Kourou, French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered 
            to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival 
            platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United States of 
            America. However, even prior to the launcher having entering 
            service, there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved 
            derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads 
            than Ariane 1 could. These desires would result in the creation 
            of both the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3.

            While the initiative was first proposed in 1978, prior to the 
            Ariane 1's first flight, approval to commence the first phase 
            of development was not received until July 1979. The bulk 
            of development work on the new launcher occurred between 1980 
            and 1982. The Ariane 2 was designed to satisfy the future 
            demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a 
            Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). According to aerospace 
            historian Brian Harvey, in spite of the numbering sequence 
            adopted, the Ariane 3 was the direct successor to the Ariane 1, 
            rather than the Ariane 2, as could be logically assumed. The 
            principal agency behind the development of the Ariane 2 was 
            the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), while the lead 
            company for its production was the French aerospace 
            manufacturer Aérospatiale.
            
            In order to keep costs down, CNES directed that only tested 
            technologies could be implemented in the launcher's 
            improvements; in fact, no budget was provided for new test 
            series to be performed. Furthermore, it was restricted to 
            using the existing launch pad and handling facilities 
            established for the Ariane 1, and that there was to be no 
            allowance for retooling of the Ariane production line. 
            However, one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted 
            was the establishment of tracking equipment in the Ivory 
            Coast; the existing infrastructure based in Brazil used by 
            the Ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased 
            performance of the Ariane 2, which flew a different ascent 
            profile than its predecessor. Performance boosts were 
            achieved via several different ways, such as the elongated 
            third stage fuel tanks to carry 30 percent more fuel, 
            elevated combustion pressure in multiple stages, a new 
            intertank structure that supported the addition of solid-fuel 
            boosters, and the adoption of a new fuel mixture.
            
            The finalised Ariane 2 is largely identical to its sibling, 
            the Ariane 3, the only major difference being the lack of 
            additional solid rocket boosters, which gave the Ariane 3 a 
            higher payload capacity at a greater unit cost. The payload 
            capacity of the Ariane 2 was 2,175 kilograms (4,795 lbs) to a 
            geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), exceeding that of the
            preceding Ariane 1.

            Performance boosts were achieved via several different ways, such as the 
            elongated third stage fuel tanks to carry 30 percent more fuel, elevated 
            combustion pressure in multiple stages, a new intertank structure that 
            supported the addition of solid-fuel boosters, and the adoption of a new 
            fuel mixture.
            
            The finalised Ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier Ariane 
            1, but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the 
            Ariane 2. Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP strap-on booster rockets 
            were used to augment the first stage at liftoff. The core of the Ariane 3 was 
            essentially identical to that of the Ariane 2. The first stage was powered by 
            four Viking 2B bipropellant engines, burning UH 25 (25% straight hydrazine, 
            75% UDMH) in a dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser. The second stage was powered by 
            a Viking 4B, which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination. The third stage 
            used a cryogenically fuelled HM7B engine, burning liquid hydrogen in liquid 
            oxygen. On some flights, a Mage 2 kick motor was flown as a fourth stage. One 
            atypical modification for the era was the revised satellite deployment system, 
            which could facilitate the launch of two smaller satellites as well as one 
            larger one.
            
            The Ariane 3's design heavily influenced that of its successor, the Ariane 4; 
            while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a 
            launcher, one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth 
            engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3. However, this was determined 
            to have involved a very high level of redesign work; an alternative approach was 
            instead adopted, in which the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of 
            propellant instead of the 145 tonnes present on the Ariane 3. While the second 
            and third stages of the Ariane 4 remained identical to the Ariane 3, a range of 
            strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, designed to gradually 
            increase the rocket's payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 15 per cent 
            smaller than the Ariane 3. It was effectively an improved and developed 
            derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, primarily differing through the application 
            of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters, the latter being the only 
            all-new design feature of the Ariane 4.

            The Ariane 4 was an expendable space launch system, developed by the Centre 
            national d'études spatiales (CNES), the French space agency, for the European 
            Space Agency (ESA). It was manufactured by ArianeGroup and marketed by 
            Arianespace. Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight 
            on 15 February 2003, it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 total launches.

            In 1982, the Ariane 4 program was approved by ESA. Drawing heavily upon the 
            preceding Ariane 3, it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering 
            heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of 
            the Ariane family. The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing 
            technologies used, as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos; this 
            approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members, who funded and 
            participated in its development and operation. Capable of being equipped with a 
            wide variety of strap-on boosters, the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an 
            extremely versatile launcher.
            
            Once in service, the launcher soon became recognized for being ideal for 
            launching communications and Earth observation satellites, as well as those used 
            for scientific research. During its working life, the Ariane 4 managed to capture 
            50% of the market in launching commercial satellites, soundly demonstrating 
            Europe's ability to compete in the commercial launch sector. In February 2003, 
            the final Ariane 4 was launched; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in 
            favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5, which effectively replaced it in service.
            
            In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space 
            exploration and formed a new pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, 
            the European Space Agency (ESA). Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival 
            of a capable European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 1 
            launcher was successfully launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais at Kourou, 
            French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive 
            launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United 
            States of America, and it was quickly followed by improved derivatives in the form of 
            the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3. By early 1986, the Ariane 1, along with the Ariane 2 and 
            Ariane 3, had become the dominant launcher on the world market.

            In January 1982, the ESA issued its authorisation for the development and construction 
            of the Ariane 4; the development programme had the stated objective of increasing the 
            usable payload by 90%. The Ariane 4 would be a considerably larger and more 
            flexible launcher that the earlier members of its family, being intended to compete 
            with the upper end of launchers worldwide. In comparison, while the Ariane 1 had a 
            typical weight of 207 tonnes and could launch payloads of up to 1.7 tonnes into orbit; 
            the larger Ariane 4 had a typical weight of 470 tonnes and could orbit payloads of up 
            to 4.2 tonnes. Work on the Ariane 4 was substantially eased via drawing heavily on both 
            the technology and experiences gained from producing and operating the earlier members 
            of the Ariane rocket. The total development cost for the Ariane 4 was valued at 476 
            million European Currency Units (ECU) in 1986.
            
            Posed with the requirement to produce a rocket with substantially greater thrust, the 
            design team considered various approaches to achieve this. One concept studied had 
            involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3, 
            but was found to involve a very high level of redesign work to achieve this; instead, 
            the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of propellant instead of the 145 
            tonnes present on the Ariane 3. While the second and third stages remained identical to 
            the Ariane 3, a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, 
            designed to gradually increase the rocket's payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 
            15% smaller than the Ariane 3.
            
            In effect, the Ariane 4 was an improved and developed derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, 
            primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled 
            boosters, the latter being the only all-new design feature of the Ariane 4; at this 
            point, the practice of using liquid boosters was uncommon, having only previously been 
            used in the Chinese space program. Another innovation of the Ariane 4 was the dual-launch 
            SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe de Lancement Double Ariane) fairing. This had the 
            function of allowing a pair of satellites, one placed on top of the other; several different 
            SPELDA nose fairings could be installed, including normal and extended models. The SPELDA 
            was considerably lighter than its predecessor; the guidance system also used much more 
            accurate ring laser gyroscopes. According to aviation author Brian Harvey, the advances 
            present in the design of the Ariane 4 represented a conservative and evolutionary, rather 
            than revolutionary, philosophy.

Ariane 5 is a heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and operated 
by Arianespace for the European Space Agency (ESA). It is launched 
from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. It has been used to 
deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth 
orbit (LEO). A direct successor system, Ariane 6, is in development 
as of July 2020.

The system was originally designed as an expendable launch system by 
the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES), the French government's 
space agency, in close cooperation with Germany and other European 
partners. Despite not being a direct derivative of its predecessor 
rocket program, it is classified as part of the Ariane rocket family. 
Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, 
leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. ESA 
originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the Hermes spaceplane, and thus 
it is rated for human space launches.

Since its first launch, Ariane 5 has been refined in successive 
versions: "G", "G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES". The system 
has a commonly used dual-launch capability, where up to two large 
geostationary belt communication satellites can be mounted using a 
SYLDA (Système de Lancement Double Ariane, "Ariane Double-Launch System") 
carrier system. Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible 
depending on size using SPELTRA (Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement 
Triple Ariane, "Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure"). Up to 
eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or minisatellites, 
can be carried with an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads) platform.

As of August 2020, Arianespace had signed contracts for Ariane 5 ECA launches 
up through 2023, approximately two years following the planned introduction 
of Ariane 6 in early 2021.

-Variants-
G: The original version is dubbed Ariane 5 G (Generic) and had a launch mass 
of 737 tonnes. Its payload capability to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) 
was 6,900 kilograms (15,200 lbs) for a single satellite or 6,100 kilograms 
(13,400 lbs) for dual launches. It flew 17 times with one failure and two 
partial failures.

G+: The Ariane 5 G+ had an improved EPS second stage, with a GTO capacity 
of 7,100 kilograms (15,700 lbs) for a single payload or 6,300 kilograms 
(13,900 lbs) for two. It flew three times in 2004, with no failures.

GS: At the time of the failure of the first Ariane 5 ECA flight in 2002, 
all Ariane 5 launchers in production were ECA versions. Some of the ECA 
cores were modified to use the original Vulcain engine and tank volumes 
while the failure was investigated; these vehicles were designated 
Ariane 5 GS. The GS used the improved EAP boosters of the ECA variant 
and the improved EPS of the G+ variant, but the increased mass of the 
modified ECA core compared to the G and G+ core resulted in slightly 
reduced payload capacity. Ariane 5 GS could carry a single payload of 
6,600 kilograms (14,600 lbs) or a dual payload of 5,800 kilograms 
(12,800 lbs) to GTO. The Ariane 5 GS flew 6 times from 2005 to 2009
    with no failures.

ECA: The Ariane 5 ECA (Evolution Cryotechnique type A), first 
successfully flown in 2005, uses an improved Vulcain 2 first-stage 
engine with a longer, more efficient nozzle with a more efficient 
flow cycle and denser propellant ratio. The new ratio required length 
modifications to the first-stage tanks. The EPS second stage was 
replaced by the ESC-A (Etage Supérieur Cryogénique-A), which has a 
dry weight of 2,100 kilograms (4,600 lbs) and is powered by an HM-7B
engine burning 14,000 kilograms (31,000 lbs) of cryogenic propellant. 
The ESC-A uses the liquid oxygen tank and lower structure from the 
Ariane 4's H10 third stage, mated to a new liquid hydrogen tank. 
Additionally, the EAP booster casings were lightened with new welds 
and carry more propellant. The Ariane 5 ECA has a GTO launch capacity 
of 9,100 kilograms (20,100 lbs) for dual payloads or 9,600 kilograms 
(21,200 lbs) for a single payload.

ES: The Ariane 5 ES (Evolution Storable) has an estimated LEO launch 
capacity of 21,000 kilograms (46,000 lbs). It includes all the 
performance improvements of Ariane 5 ECA core and boosters but 
replaces the ESC-A second stage with the restartable EPS used on Ariane 5 
GS variants. It was used to launch the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) 
into a 260 km circular low Earth orbit inclined at 51.6° and has been 
used 3 times to launch 4 Galileo navigation satellites at a time directly 
into their operational orbit. The Ariane 5 ES flew 8 times from 2008 to 
2018 with no failures.

ME: The Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) was under development until 
the end of 2014. The last ESA ministerial council of December 2014 has 
cut further funding for Ariane 5 ME in favour of developing Ariane 6. 
Last activities for Ariane 5 ME were completed at the end of 2015. 
Activities on development of the VINCI upper stage were transferred 
to Ariane 6.

M-3C rocket (Mu 3 SC Rocket), the University of Tokyo Aerospace Research Institute (after the Ministry of Education Institute of Space and Astronautical Science , currently the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, below, The University of Tokyo) is Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Aerospace Division (A three-stage solid fuel rocket for launching a scientific satellite developed jointly with Nissan, manufactured by Nissan, and operated by the University of Tokyo.)

Development was carried out using the L-4SC rocket (five launch vehicles) with the L-4S added with a guidance control device. The first stage and the third stage are non-guided, and only the second stage is guided by the liquid jet TVC and side jets.

Initially, it was planned to be developed as a 4-stage M-4SC, but it has been changed to a 3-stage type to simplify the guidance system. In the days of unguided M-4S rockets , perigee 700 km, apogee 2500 km to 4500 km (apogee varies greatly depending on the satellite weight) in order to realize reliable satellite orbital launch even if it is blown by wind. I had no choice but to launch a satellite as a "target orbit." For this reason, only the desired satellites could be manufactured according to the orbit set by the rocket, and only satellites that were significantly smaller than the actual low-orbit launch capability could be put into orbit. However, the M-3C can freely select the orbit considering the purpose and size of the satellite, and the size of the satellite that can be inserted into the orbit is larger than that of the M-4S. In addition, the launch capability itself has been slightly improved over the M-4S due to advances in rocket fuel technology.

The M-3C and M-3H rockets have many similarities in structure, and they are considered together as the second generation of the Mu rocket . Since the M-3C needed to launch a substitute for the satellite that failed to launch, it remained even after the M-3H appeared, and as a result, the M-3H ended earlier in operation.

It is often misunderstood that the M-3C rocket, M-3H rocket , M-3S rocket , and M-3SII rocket are guidance-controlled rockets, but the flight maneuver is similar to the L-4S rocket and M-4S rocket. This is the gravity turn method . The guidance control device mounted on these rockets merely corrects the deviation between the ideal flight path and the actual path set in advance by the launcher for the control in the vertical plane. After the combustion of the first stage and the second stage that flew according to the ideal path defined by the launcher was completed, the attitude was controlled by the side jet of the second stage and the spin was added by the spin motor to the third stage Flies inertially in a parabola, and starts combustion near its apex (Thrust error up to the second stage is corrected by controlling the launch direction and combustion start time of the third stage). It is from the MV rocket that the ISAS satellite launch rocket began to actively change the flight path in the vertical in-plane direction

The M-3H rocket (Mu3H) is manufactured by the Japan Aerospace Research Institute of the University of Tokyo (later the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science , Ministry of Education , now Space Aerospace Research Institute, hereinafter the University of Tokyo), Nissan Motor Aerospace Division. A three-stage solid fuel rocket for launching a scientific satellite that was jointly developed with (Nissan), manufactured by Nissan, and operated by the University of Tokyo.

The first stage of the M-3C rocket was extended to increase the launch capability. The final letter "C" of the M-3C is an acronym for "Control", which means guidance, whereas the final alphabet "H" of this rocket is taken from the acronym for "High Performance."

M-3C and M-3H have a lot in common in the structure, and both are considered together as the second generation of the Mu rocket. The M-3C was left behind after the M-3H appeared because it had to launch an alternative to the satellite that failed to launch, and as a result, the M-3H ended earlier in operation.

            Variants:
            Angara 1.2 - The smallest Angara under development is the Angara 1.2, which consists 
            of one URM-1 core and a modified Block I second stage. It has a lift-off mass of 171 
            tons and can deliver 3.8 tons of payload to a 200 km x 60° orbit.
            
            Angara A5 - The second Angara developed was the Angara A5 heavy lift launch vehicle, 
            which consists of one URM-1 core and four URM-1 boosters, a 3.6m URM-2 second stage, 
            and an upper stage, either the Briz-M or the KVTK. Weighing 773 tonnes at lift-off, 
            Angara A5 has a payload capacity of 24.5 tonnes to a 200 km x 60° orbit. Angara A5 
            is able to deliver 5.4 tons to GTO with Briz-M, or 7.5 tons to the same orbit with 
            KVTK.

            In the Angara A5, the four URM-1s used as boosters operate at full thrust for 
            approximately 214 seconds, then separate. The URM-1 forming the vehicle's core is 
            operated at full thrust for lift off, then throttled down to 30% to conserve 
            propellant. The core is throttled back up after the boosters have separated and 
            continues burning for another 110 seconds.

            The first Angara A5 test flight was on 23 December 2014.
            
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            The Angara rocket family is a family of space-launch vehicles being developed by the 
            Moscow-based Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center. The rockets are 
            to put between 3,800 and 24,500 kg into low Earth orbit and are intended, along with 
            Soyuz-2 variants, to replace several existing launch vehicles.
            
            After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many formerly Soviet launch vehicles were 
            built in or required components from companies now located in Ukraine, such as Yuzhnoye 
            Design Bureau, which produced Zenit-2, and Yuzhmash, which produced Dnepr and Tsyklon. 
            Additionally, the Soviet Union's main spaceport, Baikonur Cosmodrome, was located in 
            Kazakhstan, and Russia encountered difficulties negotiating for its use. This led 
            to the decision in 1992 to develop a new entirely Russian launch vehicle, named Angara, 
            to replace the rockets now built outside of the country, and ensure Russian access to 
            space without Baikonur. It was decided that this vehicle should ideally use the 
            partially completed Zenit-2 launch pad at the Russian Plesetsk spaceport, and be able 
            to launch military satellites into geosynchronous orbit, which Proton could not due to 
            lack of a launch pad at Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Several companies submitted bids for the 
            new rocket, and in 1994 Khrunichev, the developer of Proton, was selected as the 
            winner. The commercial success of Proton over the next two decades would be an 
            advantage to Khrunichev, as the Angara project immediately ran into funding 
            difficulties from the cash-strapped Russian government.

            Khrunichev's initial design called for the use of a modified RD-170 for first stage 
            propulsion and a liquid hydrogen powered second stage. By 1997, the hydrogen-powered 
            second stage had been abandoned in favor of kerosene, and the RD-170 was replaced 
            with a modular design which would be powered by the new RD-191, a one-chamber engine 
            derived from the four-chamber RD-170. In late 1997 Khrunichev was given approval 
            from the Russian government to proceed with their new design, which would both be 
            able to replace the ICBM-based Dnepr, Tsyklon, and Rokot with its smaller variants, 
            as well as be able to launch satellites into geostationary orbit from Plesetsk with 
            the Proton-class Angara A5. This new modular rocket would require construction 
            of a new launch pad.
            
            By 2004, the design of Angara had taken shape and the project proceeded with development 
            of the launchers. In 2008, NPO Energomash, the builder of the RD-191, reported that the 
            engine had completed development and burn tests and was ready for manufacturing and 
            delivery, and in January 2009 the first completed Angara first stage was delivered to 
            Khrunichev. The next year Vladimir Nesterov, Director-General of Khrunichev, announced 
            that the first flight test of Angara would be scheduled for 2013, and in 2013 the first 
            prototype Angara rocket arrived in Plesetsk.
            
            In 2014, 22 years after Angara's original conception, the first launch took place on 
            July 9, a suborbital test flight from the northern Plesetsk Cosmodrome. An Angara A5 was 
            launched into geosynchronous orbit in December 2014.
            
            In June, 2020, it was reported that the first Angara Launching Pad was completed and 
            would be transported to Vostochny Cosmodrome.

The Zenit-3SLB or Zenit-3M is a Ukrainian expendable carrier rocket derived from the Zenit-2SB. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets, which were designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. It is a modified version of the Zenit-3SL, designed to be launched from a conventional launch pad rather than the Sea Launch Ocean Odyssey platform.

Launches of Zenit-3SLB rockets are conducted from Site 45/1 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Commercial launches are conducted by Land Launch, and use the designation 3SLB, whilst launches conducted by Roskosmos or the Russian Space Forces will use the designation 3M.

It consists of a Zenit-2SB (Zenit-2M) core vehicle, with a Block DM-SLB upper stage. The first launch of a Zenit-3SLB occurred on 28 April 2008, carrying the Israeli AMOS-3 satellite. This was also the first commercial Zenit launch from Baikonur since a failed Globalstar launch in 1998, and the first launch to be conducted by the Land Launch consortium.

The Dnepr rocket (Ukrainian: Дніпро, romanized: Dnipró; Russian: Днепр, romanized: Dnepr) was a space launch vehicle named after the Dnieper River. It was a converted ICBM used for launching artificial satellites into orbit, operated by launch service provider ISC Kosmotras. The first launch, on April 21, 1999, successfully placed UoSAT-12, a 350 kg demonstration mini-satellite, into a 650 km circular Low Earth orbit.

--History--
The Dnepr was based on the R-36MUTTH Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) – called the SS-18 Satan by NATO – designed in the 1970s by the Yuzhnoe Design Bureau in Dnipro, Ukraine, which was then a part of the USSR.

The Dnepr control system was developed and produced by the JSC "Khartron", Kharkiv. The Dnepr was a three-stage rocket using storable hypergolic liquid propellants. The launch vehicles used for satellite launches have been withdrawn from ballistic missile service with the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces and stored for commercial use. A group of a total of 150 ICBMs were allowed under certain geopolitical disarmament protocols to be converted for use, and can be launched through 2020. The Dnepr was launched from the Russian-controlled Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Dombarovsky launch base, near Yasny, in the Orenburg region of Russia.

In February 2015, following a year of strained relations as a result of a Russian military intervention into Ukraine, Russia announced that it would sever its "joint program with Ukraine to launch Dnepr rockets and [was] no longer interested in buying Ukrainian Zenit boosters, deepening problems for [Ukraine's] space program and its struggling Yuzhmash factory." However ISC Kosmotras reported that they would continue to fulfill its obligations for three Dnepr launches in 2015, of which only one took place.

By the end of 2016, no further launch had materialized and the remaining customers had switched to alternative launch providers.

--Performance--
The Dnepr launch vehicle had only a small number of modifications compared to the R-36M ICBM in service. The main difference was the payload adapter located in the space head module and modified flight-control unit. This baseline version could lift 3,600 kg into a 300 km low earth orbit at an inclination of 50.6°, or 2,300 kg to a 300 km sun-synchronous orbit at an inclination of 98.0°. On a typical mission the Dnepr deployed a larger main payload and a secondary payload of Miniaturized satellites and CubeSats.

            The Al-Abid(Arabic: العابد‎) LV was an Iraqi three-stage "Satellite launch system", a 
            civilian project that was commenced in 1988. The Iraqis intended to launch an 
            Al-Ta'ir satellite with the help of such a launch vehicle. The Iraqis therefore 
            pursued a LV with stages based on Scud missiles and the S-75 Dvina. However only the 
            first stage could be tested on December 1989 and according to General Ra'ad the next 
            stages could not be developed. General Ra'ad says that not even the drawings of the 
            second and third stage vehicles are available and that no final report could be 
            produced. UN inspectors and U.S intelligence did not offer many details regarding the 
            Al-Abid launch vehicle as they were not interested in it.
            
            In 1988 Iraq declared a program to design as well as manufacture a LV capable of putting 
            a satellite into orbit. The project was entirely civilian and was to be carried 
            under the supervision of MIMI and had scientists from the Space Research Centre(SRC) and 
            Project 144. A special team consisting of foreign scientists was also made which 
            UNMOVIC could not identify. In general the Al-Abid project drew a large amount of 
            foreign expertise particularly from a Brazilian scientist Major General Hugo de Oliveira 
            Piva. A 50 kg satellite had already been built by Iraqi scientists. The task was to prepare 
            a Launch vehicle capable of putting a 100-300 kg payload in 200-500 km LEO which was to be 
            developed from indigenous systems, namely Scud missiles. The SRC had planned for a schedule 
            to have the first launch by 12 December 1990. When it comes to the first stage various 
            designs and configurations of the Scud missiles were studied including cluster configurations 
            involving four, five or six Scud missiles or modified Scud missiles were studied and similar 
            opinions regarding higher stages were also discussed. By early 1989 Iraqi scientists 
            had concluded on a design of five modified Scud missiles for first stage, a separated 
            modified Scud as second stage and a double base propellant for third stage, in February 
            1989 the other team of two foreign specialist proposed a different design with a 
            single Scud missile as core stage of first stage with 4-8 strap-on rockets which could 
            be Scuds or S-75 Dvinas, the second stage would be either liquid propelled or solid 
            propelled and would include an AKM, the space research centre would reject this design. 
            Initially focus was concentrated on the first-stage however work on second and third 
            stages had already commenced, initially the second stage was a 880 mm Scud missile of 
            extended burn-time however by beginning on 1989 diameter increased to 1250 mm. Initially 
            the missile had a large payload but General Ra'ad who oversaw Iraq's missile program had 
            the width of the third stage increased to 1.25 m to avoid this hammerhead shape. The 
            Iraqis would then also declare to develop a first-stage rocket engine with four Scud 
            combustion chambers and a single turbopump which would fit a 1250 mm rocket and could 
            operate DETA/UDMH as fuel however work on this would be cancelled after the Gulf War.

Shavit 2 (Hebrew: "comet" – שביט) is a small lift launch vehicle produced by Israel from 1982 onwards, to launch satellites into low Earth orbit. It was first launched on 19 September 1988 (carrying an Ofek-1 satellite payload), making Israel the eighth nation to have an orbital launch capability after the USSR, United States, France, Japan, People's Republic of China, United Kingdom, and India.

The Shavit 2 project is believed to have been an offshoot development, resulting from Israel's Jericho nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program.

Shavit rockets are launched from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over the Mediterranean Sea to prevent debris coming down in populated areas and also to avoid flying over nations hostile to Israel to the east; this results in a lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow. The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage, and is manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI).

The Republic of South Africa produced and tested a licensed version in cooperation with Israel called the RSA-3 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to produce a domestic satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile; the South African program was closed in 1994.

An earlier unrelated project called Shavit 2 was the first Israeli sounding rocket, launched on 5 July 1961 for meteorological research. Shavit Three, with an altitude reported as 100 miles (160 km), was launched on 11 August 1961.

--Development--
The development of Shavit 2 began in 1982.[8] Shavit was a three-stage, solid-propellant launcher designed to carry payloads up to 250 kg into low Earth orbit. It was speculated for some time and later confirmed that the first two stages of the Shavit were that of the Jericho II missile.

Shavit was first launched in 1988 and because of its geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, Israel had to launch it to the west, over the Mediterranean Sea, in order to avoid flying over those hostile territories to its east. The practice has continued ever since.[

--Vehicle description--
The first of the Shavit vehicles were a small, 3-stage, solid-propellant booster based on the 2-stage Jericho-II ballistic missile and developed under the general management of Israel Aircraft Industries and in particular its MBT System and Space Technology subsidiary. Israel Military Industries Systems produces the first-stage and second-stage motors, while Rafael is responsible for the third-stage motor.

A planned commercial Shavit upgrade was called Next. This name is no longer used, and this proposed upgrade configuration is now called Shavit-2. Both first and second stages of the Shavit-2 use the stretched motor design of the Shavit-1 first stage.

--Launch history--
The Shavit has been launched 11 times, placing the payload into orbit 9 times. On the 4th and 6th flights, the vehicle failed before reaching space. Most non-Israeli satellites are launched eastward to gain a boost from the Earth's rotational speed. However, the Shavit is launched westward (retrograde orbit) over the Mediterranean Sea to avoid flying and dropping spent rocket stages over populated areas in Israel and neighboring Arab countries. The Shavit is also said to be made available for commercial launches in the near future.

            Firefly Alpha (Firefly α) is a two-stage orbital expendable launch vehicle developed 
            by the American aerospace company Firefly Aerospace to cover the commercial small 
            satellite launch market. Alpha is intended to provide launch options for both full 
            vehicle and ride share customers.
            
            Alpha was initially designed with a first stage powered by an FRE-2 engine, which 
            consisted of twelve nozzles arranged in an aerospike configuration. The engine used 
            methane, as opposed to RP-1. The second stage was to be propelled by the FRE-1 engine, 
            which used a conventional bell nozzle. It was intended to launch 400 kg to low Earth 
            orbit.

            After Firefly's corporate reorganization, Alpha was redesigned. The vehicle now uses 
            two stages, both 1.8 m in diameter, filled with RP-1/LOX propellant. The main body of 
            the rocket is constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.
            
            Alpha's first stage is powered by four Reaver 1 LOX / RP-1 engines, delivering 736.1 kN 
            (165,500 lbsf) of thrust. The second stage is powered by one Lightning 1 LOX / RP-1 engine, 
            delivering 70.1 kN (15,800 lbsf) of thrust. Lightning 1 was test-run for nearly 5 minutes 
            on March 15, 2018 during a long duration test fire. The engine was fired at Firefly's 
            Test Stand 1 in Briggs, Texas.
            
            The Alpha airframe uses all carbon-fiber composite material in its construction. Use of 
            denser materials like titanium and aluminum results in a heavier airframe which requires 
            more fuel to launch, making the carbon-fiber body more fuel efficient.
            
            In March 2018, Firefly said that the development of Alpha was expected to cost approximately 
            $100 million. The company is also developing a future rocket, Firefly Beta, which initially 
            consisted of three Alpha cores strapped together. However, in October 2019, Firefly announced 
            in partnership with Aerojet Rocketdyne, that it will now be a single core rocket powered by 
            Rocketdyne's AR1 engine.
            
            
            Alpha is designed to launch a 1,000 kg payload to a 200 km low Earth orbit, or a 600 kg payload 
            to a 500 km Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. Primary 
            payloads can be integrated by themselves or with a secondary payload, with capacity for up to 
            6 CubeSats. This allows Firefly's customers to have a dedicated small-satellite launcher, 
            reducing the issues of ride-sharing payloads and secondary payloads. These smaller satellites 
            can have an orbit that is not determined by a larger payload and can launch on their own 
            schedule instead of waiting on the readiness of all other payloads.
            
            In 2015 NASA's Launch Services Program awarded Firefly Aerospace a $5.5 million Venture Class 
            Launch Services contract to develop Alpha to enable easier access to the small satellite market.
            
            Firefly Aerospace plans to use a Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) to integrate payloads.
            
            Alpha is also intended to be a direct American competitor in the small satellite market to 
            India's PSLV, as they believe its ride-share capability in the market threatens US domestic 
            launchers.

            Antares (/ænˈtɑːriːz/), known during early development as Taurus II, is an expendable 
            launch system developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation (now part of Northrop Grumman)
            and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau to launch the Cygnus spacecraft to the International 
            Station as part of NASA's COTS and CRS programs. Able to launch payloads heavier 
            than 8,000 kg (18,000 lbs) into low-Earth orbit, Antares is currently the largest 
            rocket operated by Northrop Grumman. Antares launches from the Mid-Atlantic Regional 
            Spaceport and made its inaugural flight on April 21, 2013.

            NASA awarded Orbital a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Space Act 
            Agreement (SAA) in 2008 to demonstrate delivery of cargo to the International Space 
            Station. For these COTS missions Orbital intends to use Antares to launch its Cygnus 
            spacecraft. In addition, Antares will compete for small-to-medium missions. Originally 
            designated the Taurus II, Orbital Sciences renamed the vehicle Antares, after the star 
            of the same name, on December 12, 2011.
            
            The first four Antares launch attempts were successful. During the fifth launch on 
            October 28, 2014, the rocket failed catastrophically, and the vehicle and payload were 
            destroyed. The failure was traced to a fault in the first stage engines. After 
            completion of a redesign program, the rocket had a successful return to flight on 
            October 17, 2016.
            
            The NASA COTS award was for US$171 million and Orbital Sciences expected to invest an 
            additional $150 million, split between $130 million for the booster and $20 million 
            for the spacecraft. A Commercial Resupply Service contract of $1.9 billion for 8 flights 
            was awarded in 2008. As of April 2012, development costs were estimated at $472 
            million.

            On June 10, 2008, it was announced that the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, formerly 
            part of the Wallops Flight Facility, in Virginia, would be the primary launch site for 
            the rocket. Launch pad 0A (LP-0A), previously used for the failed Conestoga rocket, 
            would be modified to handle Antares. Wallops allows launches which reach the 
            International Space Station's orbit as effectively as those from Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
            while being less crowded. The first Antares flight launched a Cygnus mass simulator.
            
            On December 10, 2009, Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) test-fired their Castor 30 motor 
            for use on the second stage of the Antares rocket. In March 2010, Orbital Sciences 
            and Aerojet completed test firings of the NK-33 engines. On February 22, 2013, a hot 
            fire test was successfully performed, the entire first stage being erected on the pad 
            and held down while the engines fired for 29 seconds.

            Ares I was the crew launch vehicle that was being developed by NASA as part of the

            identified with the Roman god Mars. Ares I was originally known as the "Crew 
            Launch Vehicle" (CLV).

            NASA planned to use Ares I to launch Orion, the spacecraft intended for NASA human 
            spaceflight missions after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Ares I was to 
            complement the larger, uncrewed Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for 
            Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, 
            reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the Constellation program, including 
            Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage 
            of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space 
            Launch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit.

            The Ares V (formerly known as the Cargo Launch Vehicle or CaLV) was the planned cargo 
            launch component of the cancelled NASA Constellation program, which was to have replaced 
            the Space Shuttle after its retirement in 2011. Ares V was also planned to carry supplies 
            for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and the smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the 
            Greek god of war.

            The Ares V was to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for NASA's return
             to the Moon, which was planned for 2019.[4] It would also have served as the principal 
             launcher for missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, including the program's ultimate goal, 
             a crewed mission to Mars. The uncrewed Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-rated 
             Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4–6 person Orion spacecraft. Both rockets, deemed 
             safer than the then-current Space Shuttle, would have employed technologies developed for 
             the Apollo program, the Shuttle program, and the Delta IV EELV program. However, the 
             Constellation program, including Ares V and Ares I was canceled in October 2010 by the NASA 
             Authorization Act of 2010. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space Launch System as its 
             new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit, while commercial space companies 
             would provide low earth orbit access for both cargo and astronauts.
             
             In the 1996 book The Case for Mars, author Robert Zubrin discussed a possible future heavy 
             launch vehicle named Ares. In the book, the rocket would have consisted of the Space Shuttle 
             external tank powered by four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) and a second stage powered 
             by an RL-10 engine. One notable difference in the Zubrin et al. design is that the SSMEs were 
             on a small side-mounted flyback craft. This design was meant to allow the Ares to fly using 
             existing Space Shuttle infrastructure.
             
             Ares V was to be the cargo launch component of the Constellation program. Unlike the Saturn V 
             and Space Shuttle, where the crew and cargo were launched together on the same rocket, Project 
             Constellation planned to use two separate launch vehicles, the Ares I and the Ares V, for crew 
             and cargo respectively. This configuration would have allowed the two launch vehicles to be 
             optimized for their respective missions. Constellation therefore combined the Lunar Orbit 
             Rendezvous used by Apollo with the Earth Orbit Rendezvous mode proposed by Dr. Wernher von 
             Braun (along with the "Direct Ascent" proposal) during the early planning stage of Apollo.
             
             Development of the rocket and its Earth departure stage was led by NASA's Marshall Space Flight 
             Center. NASA Ames Research Center was responsible for the Ares V integrated health management 
             system supports in developing its payload shroud. Glenn Research Center led the development of 
             the lunar lander ascent stage as well as Ares V power system, thrust vector control system and 
             payload shroud. Langley Research Center had a lead role on Ares V aerodynamics.

            In 2007, NASA announced that Alliant Techsystems will be the contractor for the SRBs of both 
            Ares I and Ares V.
            
            Although the Ares V was a medium to long term project, NASA planned to deploy its lift capability 
            in a range of projects,[10] along the lines of the former Apollo Applications Program.

            One proposal was to build an 8- to 16-meter Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope to 
            be placed in the Sun/Earth L2 point. It would be a significant increase in dimension and 
            performance over the Hubble Space Telescope and the Ares V vehicle was expected to carry this 
            to its destination in a single launch.
 Future Ares V missions could also have 
            served as a cost-effective, mass transport of construction materials for future spacecraft and 
            missions, delivering raw materials for example to a Moon dock.
            
            In May 2010, NASA planned flight demonstrations of Ares V hardware along with Ares I hardware 
            after the scheduled upcoming Ares I-X Prime test of the Ares I five-segment SRB first stage. 
            Several flights were listed as "Heavy Lift" test flights for testing the first stage of the 
            Ares V simultaneously with the Ares I upper stage attached on top of the Ares V first stage. 
            This would save both time and money in avoiding the gap between testing Ares I and Ares V 
            hardware with limited funding.

The Thor-Delta, also known as Delta DM-19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s. A derivative of the Thor-Able, it was a member of the Thor family of rockets, and the first member of the Delta family.

The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM-19 configuration. The second stage was the Delta, which had been derived from the earlier Able stage. An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage.

The basic design of the original Vanguard upper stages, featuring a pressure-fed nitric acid/UDMH, regeneratively cooled engine, was kept in place, but with an improved AJ10-118 engine. More significantly, the Delta stage featured cold gas attitude control jets allowing it to be stabilized in orbit for restart and more precise burns.

The Thor-Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage. This configuration was reused for many later rockets, and a derivative, the Delta II, remained in service until 2018.

The Thor-Delta launched a number of significant payloads, including the first communications satellite, Echo 1A; the first British satellite, Ariel 1; and the first active direct-relay communications satellite, Telstar 1. All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17. The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B, while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight, which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due to a problem with the second stage.

            Liberty was a 2011 launch vehicle concept proposed by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and 
            Astrium for phase 2 of the NASA Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program intended 
            to stimulate development of privately operated crew vehicles to low Earth orbit.

            Similar to the defunct Ares I project, which consisted of a five segment Space 
            Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a new cryogenic second stage, Liberty would 
            combine a five-segment SRB with the core stage of the European Ariane 5 as a second 
            stage. It was intended to be launched from Kennedy Space Center.
            
            Liberty was proposed as a vehicle to service the International Space Station for 
            crew and cargo, but its capacities could potentially have allowed for government and 
            commercial satellite launches, including to Geostationary transfer orbit.
            
            The launcher was proposed to be 300 feet (91 m) in height, with an advertised price 
            of $180 million per launch. Liberty had a projected payload of 44,500 lbs (20,000 kg) 
            to Low Earth orbit.
            
            The ATK/Astrium Liberty proposal was not initially selected by NASA in the 2011 contract 
            awards to assist development of a commercial space transportation system to replace the 
            Space Shuttle; however, the team continued development in the hope of gaining funding 
            from NASA in future years. On September 13, 2011, NASA and ATK held a joint news 
            conference to announce they had signed an unfunded Space Act Agreement (SAA) to 
            collaborate on the development of the Liberty Transportation System as part of the 
            agency's Commercial Crew Development Round 2 activities. NASA suggested this agreement 
            could "accelerate the availability of U.S. commercial crew transportation capabilities."

            In January 2012 NASA's Commercial Crew office announced ATK had successfully held a Launch 
            System Initial Systems Design (ISD) Review of the Liberty Transportation System, the third 
            of five milestones to be completed under the SAA. The current SAA continued through at 
            least March 2012.
            
            Liberty was not among the vehicles selected for funding announced on August 3, 2012 under 
            the Commercial Crew Integrated Capacity program.[11] ATK's stated goal prior to the CCiCAP 
            award announcement was to begin test launches in 2015, with a crewed flight in 2016. In 
            early August 2012, shortly before NASA announced the selectees for CCDev award, ATK Liberty 
            manager Kent Rominger stated that the program would continue even without CCiCAP funding. 
            However, following the NASA decision not to select Liberty as a design for further 
            government funding, ATK president and CEO Mark DeYoung stated that the company was 
            "'moving on' after the failure to win a NASA contract reassessing their plans and the 
            decision would not cause any financial hardship."
            
            In May 2012 ATK announced that Liberty would indeed be a complete commercial crew 
            transportation system, including the spacecraft, abort system, launch vehicle, and ground 
            and mission operations. The spacecraft was to be narrowly derived from concepts generated 
            during the Orion program, and make use of the Orion Service Module. ATK projected that 
            the first launch could have taken place as early as 2013, with astronauts launching by 
            2015.

            The spacecraft would be made of ATK's composite space shell developed as an alternative 
            to the Orion's aluminum lithium structure. It would carry up to 7 crew members to and 
            from the ISS or other space stations and was designed with commercial customers in mind. 
            Some designs had an integrated unpressurized storage bay in between the crew module and 
            service module that allowed the spacecraft to carry 5000 pounds of cargo in a pressurized 
            container. This cargo would be berthed to the station by the Canadarm 2. It could also 
            carry up to four unpressurized science pallets to be attached to the station by crew 
            members on EVA or the Canadarm 2. The vehicle would rely on an ATK Max Launch Abort System 
            designed for the Orion spacecraft. The spacecraft would be able to launch both crew and 
            cargo like the Shuttle although it would not be able to return said cargo.
