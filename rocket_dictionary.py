            Saturn V was an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle 
            certified for human-rating used by NASA between 1967 and 
            1973. It consisted of three stages, each fueled by liquid 
            propellants. It was developed to support the Apollo program 
            for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to 
            launch Skylab, the first American space station.

            The Saturn V was launched 13 times from Kennedy Space Center 
            with no loss of crew or payload. As of 2020, the Saturn V 
            remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest 
            total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, 
            and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and 
            largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of 
            310,000 lb (140,000 kg), which included the third stage 
            and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command 
            and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon.

            As the largest production model of the Saturn family of 
            rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of 
            Wernher von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
            Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, 
            Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors.

            To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry 
            humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15 flight-capable 
            vehicles were built, but only 13 were flown. An additional 
            three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes. A total 
            of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon in the four years 
            spanning December 1968 through December 1972.

            Soyuz is a series of spacecraft designed for the Soviet space 
            program by the Korolev Design Bureau (now RKK Energia) in the
            1960s that remains in service today, having made more than 140 
            flights. The Soyuz succeeded the Voskhod spacecraft and was 
            originally built as part of the Soviet crewed lunar programs. 
            The Soyuz spacecraft is launched on a Soyuz rocket, the most 
            reliable launch vehicle in the world to date. The Soyuz 
            rocket design is based on the Vostok launcher, which in turn was 
            based on the 8K74 or R-7A Semyorka, a Soviet intercontinental 
            ballistic missile. All Soyuz spacecraft are launched from the 
            Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. After the retirement of the 
            Space Shuttle in 2011, the Soyuz served as the only means for 
            Americans to make crewed space flights until the first flight 
            of VSS Unity in 2018, and the only means for Americans to reach 
            the International Space Station until the first flight of Dragon 
            2 Crew variant on May 30, 2020. The Soyuz is heavily used in 
            the ISS program.

            The first Soyuz flight was uncrewed and started on November 28, 
            1966. The first Soyuz mission with a crew, Soyuz 1, launched on 
            23 April 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure, 
            killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. The following flight was 
            uncrewed. Soyuz 3, launched on October 26, 1968, became the 
            program's first successful crewed mission. The only other flight 
            to suffer a fatal accident, Soyuz 11, killed its crew of three 
            when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry. 
            These were the only humans to date to have died above the Kármán 
            line. Despite these early incidents, Soyuz is widely considered 
            the world's safest, most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle, 
            established by its unparalleled length of operational history. 
            Soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from Salyut 
            and later Mir Soviet space stations, and are now used for transport 
            to and from the International Space Station (ISS). At least one Soyuz 
            spacecraft is docked to ISS at all times for use as an escape craft 
            in the event of an emergency. The spacecraft is intended to be 
            replaced by the six-person Orel spacecraft.

            The Delta III rocket was an expendable launch vehicle made by 
            Boeing. The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of 
            its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, 
            though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted 
            orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta 
            III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its 
            predecessor, the Delta II. Under the 4-digit designation system 
            from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the 
            Delta 8930.

            Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene 
            and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main 
            engine with two vernier engines for roll control. While the 
            propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical 
            to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased 
            from 2.4 meters to 4 meters. This reduced the overall length of 
            the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch 
            facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications. First 
            stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, 
            sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). 
            These were 14.7 meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, 
            and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about 6 metric tons more than 
            the Delta II's standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch 
            pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and 
            separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, 
            three of the boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would 
            later find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.

            Ariane 6 is a launch vehicle developed and manufactured by 
            ArianeGroup under the authority of the European Space Agency 
            (ESA), with a first test flight scheduled for 2020 or, now 
            more likely, 2021. When development is completed, it will 
            become the newest member in the Ariane launch vehicle family. 
            The final design was selected in December 2014, favoring a 
            liquid-fuelled core with large solid rocket boosters over the 
            initial solid-fuel rocket design. The motivation for 
            Ariane 6 development was to replace Ariane 5 at half the cost, 
            and allow double the number of launches each year.

            Ariane 6 was initially conceived in the early 2010s as a 
            replacement launch vehicle for Ariane 5, and a number of 
            concepts and high-level designs were suggested and proposed 
            during 2012–2015. Funding from several European governments 
            was secured by early 2016, and contracts were signed to begin 
            detailed design and the build of test articles. While in 2019, 
            the maiden orbital flight had been planned for 2020, by May 
            2020, the planned initial launch date had been delayed until 2021.

            The VLS-1 (Portuguese: Veículo Lançador de Satélites)
            was the Brazilian Space Agency's main satellite launch 
            vehicle. The launch vehicle was to be capable of 
            launching satellites into orbit. The launch site was 
            located at the Alcântara Launch Center due to its 
            proximity to the equator.

            Associated vehicles include the Sonda I, Sonda II, 
            Sonda III and Sonda IV, the VS-30, VS-40 and VSB-30.

            The VLS was cancelled after decades of development 
            and high expenditures with poor results and a failed 
            association with Ukraine that slowed the program 
            for years.

            VLS-1 development started in 1984, after the first 
            launch of the Sonda IV rocket. To date, three 
            prototypes have been built and two launches attempted, 
            departing from the Alcântara Launch Center. During

            technical problems prevented mission success, but 
            allowed the testing of several vehicle components. 
            The V3 prototype exploded on the launch pad on 22 
            August 2003, two days before its intended launch date. 
            The 2003 Alcântara VLS accident caused a considerable 
            setback to the Brazilian space program. The V4 
            prototype was expected to be launched in 2016.

            The VLM (Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites) is a 
            proposed three-stage satellite launcher being developed 
            by the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology 
            in collaboration with Germany. The project originated 
            in 2008 as a simplified version of the VLS-1 rocket, 
            using only the core stages.

            A version based on the S-50 rocket engine is being 
            developed, with the objective of launching satellites 
            of up to 150 kg into equatorial circular orbits at 
            300 km altitude.

            Development on VLM started in 2008 for the purpose of 
            low-cost and reliable launch of microsatellites. 
            Initially, a four-stage rocket using solid fuel was 
            proposed, arranged in the following order:

            Stage 1: S-43 rocket engine
            Stage 2: S-40TM rocket engine
            Stage 3: S-44 rocket engine
            Stage 4: S-33 rocket engine

            It was later decided in 2011 to build a precursor 
            single-stage rocket bearing a new engine called S-50. 
            The vehicle is being developed and its engine tested 
            in collaboration with the German Space Agency (DLR).
            This precursor test is called VS-50 and is planned for 
            launch in 2019. The VS-50 vehicle measures 12 m (39 ft) 
            long, 1.46 m (4 ft 9 in) in diameter, and has a mass of 
            about 15 tons.

            All launches are planned to take place from the Alcântara 
            Launch Center, located on Brazil's northern Atlantic coast.

            Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1) was small, solid fueled launch vehicle 
            based on the road mobile DF-21 IRBM with an additional 
            upper stage (in total 4 stages[1]). It was 13.6 meters 
            in length and 1.4 meters in diameter, with launch mass 
            of 20t. It was possible to launch KT-1 both from a 
            truck-based platform or from airborne platform. It had 
            a 100 kg to LEO payload capacity. It was possibly the 
            launch vehicle for a Chinese ASAT system that was tested 
            against an old Chinese weather satellite in 2007.

            The vehicle has performed two flights, the first in 15 
            September 2002 and the second 16 September 2003. The 
            first flight failed to place a 50 kg satellite into 
            polar orbit due to a second stage malfunction. The 
            second flight was also a failure, however Chinese 
            officials declared some success citing the guidance 
            systems, fairing separation and satellite-launcher 
            separation as successful. The second launch sent the 
            payload, PS-2 microsatellite (40 kg) into wrong orbit. 
            The satellite completed barely one orbit before 
            re-entering the atmosphere.

            The Kaituozhe-1 launcher appears to have been cancelled 
            after two unsuccessful launches. A third (in 2004) and 
            fourth launch have been rumored, but are not confirmed.

            The rocket had three variants: the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1), 
            the Kaituozhe-1A (KT-1A, originally designated KT-2, not 
            to be confused with KT-2 below) and the Kaituozhe-1B

            Kuaizhou (KZ, Chinese: 快舟; pinyin: kuàizhōu, meaning 
            "speedy vessel") (also called Feitian Emergency Satellite 
            Launch System, Feitian-1, FT-1) is a family of Chinese 
            "quick-reaction" orbital launch vehicles. Flying since 
            2013, Kuaizhou 1 and 1A consist of three solid-fueled rocket 
            stages, with a liquid-fueled fourth stage as part of the 
            satellite system. Kuaizhou 11, which flew an unsuccessful 
            maiden flight in July 2020, is a larger model able to launch 
            a 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb) payload into low Earth orbit. 
            Heavy-lift models KZ-21 and KZ-31 are in development. The 
            Kuaizhou series of rockets is manufactured by ExPace, a 
            subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation 
            (CASIC), as their commercial launch vehicles.

            The rocket series is based on CASIC's ASAT and BMD mid-course 
            interceptor rockets, in particular the DF-21 IRBM (another 
            Chinese rocket that was based on DF-21 was the Kaituozhe-1). 
            Development on the KZ rockets started in 2009. The KZ rockets
            were to provide an integrated launch vehicle system with the 
            rapid ability to replace Chinese satellites that might be 
            damaged or destroyed in an act of aggression in orbit. The 
            vehicle uses mobile launch platform. The rocket is operated 
            by the Chinese 2nd Artillery.

            The maiden flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 1 
            natural disaster monitoring satellite, occurred on 25 September 
            2013, launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            Second flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 2 natural 
            disaster monitoring satellite, was launched at 06:37 UTC on 21 
            November 2014, again from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            The first commercial launch inaugurated the Kuaizhou 1A version 
            on 9 January 2017, from Jiuquan. It placed three small satellites 
            into a polar orbit.

            Long March 1D was a member of China's Long March rocket 
            family. During the 1990s CALT developed an improved 
            version of the DF-4 to test the reentry vehicle warheads 
            of the DF-31.[6][7][8] They took advantage of this 
            development and offered it as the Long March 1D for 
            commercial application. The modifications included:

            An DF-4 improved first stage, which used the new version 
            of the YF-2B, and switched propellants to UDMH/N2O4 for 
            improved performance. The replacement of the DF-4 second 
            stage motor YF-3A. The proposed replacement was the Long 
            March 4 third stage engine, the YF-40. A new inline 
            inter-stage would replace the existing tapered connector 
            between the second and third stages, which allowed for an 
            additional 70cm diameter to be added to the third stage 
            skirt. This would allow for the addition of RCS to the 
            third stage. A new third stage with a new motor, the FG-36 
            and an optional RCS. A new computer inertial guidance system 
            which enabled the third stage to be 3-axis stabilised for 
            added precision. The new design did not have a good reception 
            and was only used for reentry vehicle tests. It flew three 
            suborbital missions from Taiyuan LC-1 with two successes and 
            a failure on the final mission. The first launch was on 
            June 1, 1995 and the second one was in November 1997. The 
            final and failed launch was on January 3, 2002.

            Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit 
            medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by 
            SpaceX in the United States. It is powered by Merlin 
            engines, also developed by SpaceX, burning cryogenic 
            liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as 
            propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional 
            Star Wars spacecraft, the Millennium Falcon, and the 
            nine Merlin engines of the rocket's first stage. The rocket 
            evolved with versions v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016), 
            v1.2 "Full Thrust" (2015–present), including the Block 5 
            Full Thrust variant, flying since May 2018. Unlike most 
            rockets, which are expendable launch systems, since the 
            introduction of the Full Thrust version, Falcon 9 is 
            partially reusable, with the first stage capable of 
            re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after 
            separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved 
            for the first time on flight 20 with the v1.2 version in 
            December 2015.

            Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms 
            (50,300 lb) to low Earth orbit, 8,300 kg (18,300 lb) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) when expended, and 
            5,500 kg (12,100 lb) to GTO when the first stage is 
            recovered. The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been 
            Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lb), and Telstar 19V 
            with 7,075 kg (15,598 lb). The latter was launched into a 
            lower-energy GTO orbit achieving an apogee well below the 
            geostationary altitude, while the former was launched into 
            an advantageous super-synchronous transfer orbit.

            In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) 
            contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services 
            (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space 
            Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first 
            mission under this contract launched on October 8, 2012. Falcon 
            9 has been human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the 
            ISS as part of the NASA Commercial Crew Development program. 
            Currently, Falcon 9 has been certified for the National Security 
            Space Launch[22] program and NASA Launch Services Program as 
            "Category 3", which can launch the priciest, most important, and 
            most complex NASA missions.

            Five rockets of the version 1.0 design were launched from June 2010 
            to March 2013. Version 1.1 conducted fifteen launches from September 
            2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version was in service from 
            December 2015 into 2018, with several additional upgrades within 
            this version. The latest variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 
            2018. It features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and 
            other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon 
            Heavy derivative, introduced in February 2018, consists of a 
            strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its center core, attached to 
            two standard Falcon 9 first stages used as boosters.

            rocket ever launched successfully (behind the Saturn V and 
            Energia).

            SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 
            2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC). The rocket carried a Tesla
            Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, carrying a dummy 
            dubbed "Starman", as a dummy payload. The second Falcon Heavy 
            launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets 
            successfully returned to earth.[10] The third Falcon Heavy launch 
            successfully occurred on June 25, 2019. Since then, the Falcon 
            Heavy has been certified for the National Security Space Launch 
            program.

            The Falcon Heavy was designed to be able to carry humans into space 
            beyond low Earth orbit, although as of February 2018, SpaceX has 
            confirmed that they will not transport people on the Falcon Heavy, 
            nor pursue the human-rating certification process to transport NASA 
            astronauts. The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the

            Lockheed Martin, now being operated by United Launch Alliance 
            (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing.

            Each Atlas V rocket consists of two main stages. The first 
            stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine manufactured by 
            RD Amross and burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The Centaur 
            upper stage is powered by one or two US RL10 engine(s) 
            manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne and burning liquid 
            hydrogen and liquid oxygen. AJ-60A strap-on solid rocket 
            boosters (SRBs) are used in some configurations and will 
            be replaced by GEM-63 SRBs in the near future. The standard 
            payload fairings are 4 or 5 meters in diameter with various
            lengths.

            The Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch

            41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Space Launch Complex 
            3-E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LMCLS continued to market the 
            Atlas V to commercial customers worldwide until January 2018,

            The Space Launch System (SLS) is a super heavy-lift expendable 
            launch vehicle, which has been under development by NASA in the 
            United States since its announcement in 2011. It is the primary 
            launch vehicle of NASA's deep space exploration plans, including 
            the planned crewed lunar flights of the Artemis program and a 
            possible follow-on human mission to Mars. The SLS program has 
            replaced the Constellation program's Ares V launch vehicle program
            of 2005, which never left the development phase. SLS is intended 
            to replace the retired Space Shuttle as NASA's flagship vehicle. 
            Following the cancelation of the Constellation program, the NASA 
            Authorization Act of 2010 envisioned a single launch vehicle usable 
            for both crew and cargo. In 2013, SLS was projected to possibly be 
            the most capable super-heavy lift vehicle ever built.

            The initial variant of SLS, Block 1, was required by the US Congress 
            to lift a payload of 70 tonnes (69 long tons; 77 short tons) to low 
            Earth orbit (LEO), but it was later planned to exceed that requirement 
            with a rated payload capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons; 105 short 
            tons). As of 22 December 2019, this variant is planned to launch 
            Artemis 1, Artemis 2, Artemis 3, and Europa Clipper. The later Block 
            1B is intended to debut the Exploration Upper Stage and launch the 
            notional Artemis 4 through Artemis 7. Block 2 is planned to replace 
            the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and would 
            have a LEO capability of more than 130 tonnes (130 long tons; 140 short 
            tons), again as required by Congress.[ Block 2 is intended to enable 
            crewed launches to Mars. SLS is to have the world's highest-ever 
            total thrust at launch, but not the world's highest ever payload 
            mass. The SLS is planned to launch the Orion spacecraft and use the 
            ground operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center 
            in Florida.

            New Glenn, named after John Glenn, is a heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle 
            in development by Blue Origin. Design work on the vehicle began in 2012. 
            Illustrations of the vehicle, and the high-level specifications, were 
            initially publicly unveiled in September 2016. New Glenn is described as 
            a two-stage rocket with a diameter of 7 meters (23 ft). Its first stage 
            will be powered by seven BE-4 engines that are also being designed and 
            manufactured by Blue Origin.

            Like the New Shepard suborbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the 
            New Glenn's first stage is designed to be reusable. Originally intended 
            for first launch in 2020, by 2018 Blue Origin expected to launch New 
            Glenn in 2021, which remains the current target.

            After initiating the development of an orbital rocket system prior to 
            2012, and stating in 2013 on their website that the first stage would do 
            a powered vertical landing and be reusable, Blue Origin publicly announced 
            their orbital launch vehicle intentions in September 2015. In January 2016, 
            Blue Origin indicated that the new rocket would be many times larger than 
            New Shepard even though it would be the smallest of the family of Blue Origin 
            orbital vehicles. Blue Origin publicly released the high-level design of 
            the vehicle—and announced the name New Glenn—in September 2016.

            H-IIA (H-2A) is an active expendable launch system operated by Mitsubishi 
            Heavy Industries (MHI) for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. These liquid 
            fuel rockets have been used to launch satellites into geostationary orbit; lunar 
            orbiting spacecraft; Akatsuki, which studied the planet Venus; and the Emirates 
            Mars Mission, which was launched to Mars in July 2020. Launches occur at the 
            Tanegashima Space Center. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. As of July 2020, H-IIA 
            rockets were launched 42 times, including 36 consecutive missions without a 
            failure, dating back to 29 November 2003.

            Production and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on 1 April 2007. 
            Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter SELENE, was the first H-IIA launched 
            after this privatization.

            The H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier H-II rocket, substantially redesigned to 
            improve reliability and minimize costs. There have been four variants, with two 
            in active service (as of 2020) for various purposes. A derivative design, the H-IIB, 
            was developed in the 2000s and made its maiden flight in 2009.

            The Diamant rocket (Diamant is French for "diamond") was the 
            first exclusively French expendable launch system and at the 
            same time the first satellite launcher not built by either 
            the United States or USSR. As such, it has been referred to 
            as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher 
            projects.

            During 1962, development of the Diamant commenced as the 
            inaugural spacecraft project of France's space agency, the Centre 
            National d'Études Spatiales (CNES). As a project, it was derived 
            from the military program Pierres précieuses (fr.: gemstones) that 
            included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis and 
            Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire), and drew heavily 
            upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously 
            developed. On 26 November 1965, the Diamant A performed its maiden 
            flight. Out of a total of 12 aunch attempts to be performed between 
            1965 and 1975, 9 of these were successful. Most notably, on 26 November 
            1965, the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French 
            satellite, named Astérix.

            Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed, 
            designated A, B and BP4. All versions had three stages and a 
            payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit. Despite the 
            success of the Diamant as a launcher, France ultimately chose to 
            terminate further work on its national launcher program in favor 
            of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what 
            would become the Ariane launcher in 1975.

            OTRAG (German: Orbital Transport und Raketen AG, or Orbital Transport 
            nd Rockets, Inc.), was a German company based in Stuttgart, which in 
            the late 1970s and early 1980s planned to develop an alternative 
            propulsion system for rockets. OTRAG was the first commercial developer 
            and producer of space launch vehicles. The OTRAG Rocket claimed to 
            present an inexpensive alternative to existing launch systems through 
            mass-production of Common Rocket Propulsion Units (CRPU).

            OTRAG was founded in 1975 by the German aerospace engineer Lutz Kayser. 
            OTRAG's goal was to develop, produce, and operate a low cost satellite 
            launch vehicle. It was the first private company to attempt to launch a 
            private spacecraft. The OTRAG rocket was intended to be an inexpensive 
            alternative to the European rocket Ariane and the NASA Space Shuttle. 
            Kayser and a private consortium of six hundred European investors 
            financed the development and production of the OTRAG satellite launch 
            vehicle. Dr. Kurt H. Debus served as Chairman of the Board of OTRAG after 
            his retirement as director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and Dr. 
            Wernher von Braun served as scientific adviser to Kayser.

            In the face of doubts by Debus and von Braun, Kayser chose in 1975 to set 
            up testing and launch facilities in Shaba, Zaire (now Katanga Province in 
            the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Debus and von Braun were concerned 
            about the possibility of Zairian acquisition of missile technology from 
            the facilities. Kayser decided to proceed despite their opposition.

            Otrag's first test was on May 17, 1977, with the second successful launch 
            on May 20, 1978. The third test failed on June 5, with Zairian President 
            Mobutu Sese Seko watching the launch.

            Political pressure to halt the company's operations mounted quickly. 
            France and the Soviet Union were historically opposed to German 
            long-distance rocket development, and pressured the Zairian government 
            into closing down the development facility in 1979. Immediately afterwards, 
            Presidents Giscard d'Estaing of France and Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet 
            Union convinced the West German government to cancel the OTRAG project and 
            close down its German operations. In 1980, OTRAG moved its production and 
            testing facilities to a desert site in Libya. A series of successful tests 
            were conducted at this site beginning in 1981.

            OTRAG shut down in 1987. As the company left Libya, Muammar Gaddafi 
            confiscated all equipment and installations, hoping to later use the 
            technology, and German investors lost their money.

            The M-4S rocket (MU4S rocket) was developed by the Institute of Aeronautics 
            and Astronautics of the University of Tokyo (hereinafter referred to as the 
            University of Tokyo) jointly with the Nissan Motor Aerospace Division 
            (hereinafter referred to as the Nissan), manufactured by Nissan, and 
            operated by the University of Tokyo. It is a solid fuel rocket . 4 units 
            were launched from Uchinoura Space Center and 3 units succeeded. This 
            section also describes M-1, M-3D, which is a full-scale preliminary test 
            machine for M-4S.

            It was developed based on the technology of the L-4S rocket . All stages 
            consist of solid-fuel rockets that do not have a guidance device, and 
            carry out satellite orbit injection by the gravity turn method . Due to 
            the relationship with the launch launcher, the tail can not be installed 
            in the second stage, and after launch, the flare that opens like an 
            umbrella at the rear end of the second stage stabilizes the posture. 
            The tail area of the first stage is also smaller than that of 
            the L-4S relative to the rocket body. For this reason, the flight 
            stability is lower than that of the L-4S, but the probability of 
            satellite orbit injection can be secured by optimizing the orbit design 
            based on the thrust margin. Basically, each satellite of M-4S was 
            launched as a "target orbit" with all satellites near 700 km perigee 
            and 2500-4500 km apogee (apogee changes significantly depending on 
            satellite weight) (in this orbit) , Satellite orbits are most likely 
            to be established, even if swept by the wind, exceeding 95%). This is 
            the reason why the weights of all the satellites that are thrown in 
            are less than half of the low-orbit launch capability in the catalog.

            The first unit was launched on September 25, 1970 (Showa 45) , but 
            failed to put the satellite into orbit. Unit 4 from Unit 2 , 1971 
            in February from 1972 August was launched subjected to.
