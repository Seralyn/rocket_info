Saturn V was an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle 
certified for human-rating used by NASA between 1967 and 
1973. It consisted of three stages, each fueled by liquid 
propellants. It was developed to support the Apollo program 
for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to 
launch Skylab, the first American space station.

The Saturn V was launched 13 times from Kennedy Space Center 
with no loss of crew or payload. As of 2020, the Saturn V 
remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest 
total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, 
and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and 
largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of 
310,000 lbs (140,000 kg), which included the third stage 
and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command 
and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon.

As the largest production model of the Saturn family of 
rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of 
Wernher von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, 
Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors.

To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry 
humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15 flight-capable 
vehicles were built, but only 13 were flown. An additional 
three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes. A total 
of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon in the four years 
spanning December 1968 through December 1972.

In September 1945, the US government brought the German rocket technologist 
Wernher von Braun and about seven hundred German rocket engineers and 
technicians to the United States for Operation Paperclip, a program authorized 
by President Truman.

Von Braun was assigned to the Army's rocket design division due to his 
prior direct involvement in the creation of the V-2 rocket. Between 1945 
and 1958, his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind 
the V-2 to American engineers. Despite von Braun's many articles on the 
future of space rocketry, the US government continued funding Air Force 
and Navy rocket programs to test their Vanguard missiles despite numerous 
costly failures.

The US Army and government began taking serious steps towards sending 
Americans into space in 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 atop 
an R-7 ICBM, which is capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead to the 
US. They turned to von Braun's team, who had created and experimented 
with the Jupiter series of rockets. 

The Juno I rocket launched the first American satellite in January 1958, 
and was part of the last-ditch plan for NACA (the predecessor of NASA) to 
participate in the Space Race. Von Braun considered the Jupiter series to 
be a prototype and referred to it as "an infant Saturn".

Soyuz-2 (GRAU index 14A14) is a modernised version of the Russian Soyuz rocket. In 
its basic form, it is a three-stage carrier rocket for placing payloads into low Earth 
orbit. Compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz, the first-stage boosters and two 
core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems. Digital flight 
control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, 
whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket 
could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.

Soyuz-2 is often flown with an upper stage, which allows it to lift payloads into higher 
orbits, such as Molniya and geosynchronous orbits. The upper stage is equipped with 
independent flight control and telemetry systems from those used in the rest of the rocket. 
The NPO Lavochkin manufactured Fregat is the most commonly used upper stage.

Soyuz-2 rockets were first launched from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and Site 43 
at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived rockets 
including the Soyuz-U and Molniya. Commercial Soyuz-2 flights are contracted by Starsem 
and have launched from Site 31 at Baikonur Cosmodrome and ELS (Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz), 
which has been built at the Centre Spatial Guyanais on the northern coast of South America. 
The Soyuz-2 version ST-B can deliver 3,250 kilograms (7,170 lbs) to geostationary transfer 
orbit (GTO) from this equatorial site. In 2016, the new Vostochny Cosmodrome started operating 
Soyuz-2 flights as well, from its first launch pad called Site 1S.

The Soyuz-2 has replaced the Molniya-M, Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG since 2010, 2017 and 2019 respectively. 
TsSKB-Progress halted production of Soyuz-U in April 2015; the final flight of a Soyuz-U rocket took 
place on 22 February 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station. According to 
CNES officials interviewed in May 2018, launches of Soyuz from Guiana may be replaced by the Ariane 
6 medium-lift version A62 in 2021.

---Variants---
The Soyuz-2 family includes 2.1a, 2.1b, and 2.1v. The first two variants are modifications to the 
Soyuz-U launcher. The latter is a "light" version without side boosters.

When launched from the Kourou site, Soyuz-2 is always mated with the ST-type fairing; this version 
is called Soyuz-ST or Soyuz-STK, where additional "K" indicates special measures taken for preparing 
and launching the rocket in hot and humid conditions.


Soyuz-2.1a
The 2.1a version includes conversion from analog to digital flight control system and uprated 
engines on the booster and the first stage with improved injection systems. The new digital flight
control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to launch from a fixed rather than angled launch 
platform and adjust its heading in flight. A digital control system also enables the launch of 
larger commercial satellites with wider and longer payload fairings such as the ST-type fairing. 
These fairings introduce too much aerodynamic instability for the old analog system to handle. 
This stage continues to use the RD-0110 engine.

The 2.1a/ST version is sometimes called Soyuz ST-A. The first launch, from Guiana, (17 December 
2011 for Pl√©iades-HR 1A, SSOT, ELISA (4 satellites)) was a success.

Soyuz-2.1b
The 2.1b version adds an upgraded engine (RD-0124) which greatly increases the specific impulse 
of the upper stage (326 seconds to 359 seconds). First launch took place from Plesetsk Cosmodrome 
Site 43 on 26 July 2008 with a classified military payload.

The 2.1b/ST version is sometimes called Soyuz ST-B. The first launch, from Guiana, was a success 
(21 October 2011), for the first two Galileo IOV satellites.

Soyuz-2.1v
Main article: Soyuz-2.1v
The first flight vehicle of the 2.1v version was finished in 2009. It is a "light" version of 
the Soyuz-2 without the side boosters (blocks B, V, G and D[clarification needed]). The Block A 
engine was replaced by the more powerful NK-33-1, which as of 2009, was to eventually be replaced 
with the RD-193.[needs update] The new launcher version was able to deliver up to 2.8 tonnes in 
low Earth orbit.

            The Delta III rocket was an expendable launch vehicle made by 
            Boeing. The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of 
            its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, 
            though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted 
            orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta 
            III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its 
            predecessor, the Delta II. Under the 4-digit designation system 
            from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the 
            Delta 8930.

            Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene 
            and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main 
            engine with two vernier engines for roll control. While the 
            propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical 
            to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased 
            from 2.4 meters to 4 meters. This reduced the overall length of 
            the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch 
            facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications. First 
            stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, 
            sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). 
            These were 14.7 meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, 
            and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about 6 metric tons more than 
            the Delta II's standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch 
            pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and 
            separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, 
            three of the boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would 
            later find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.

--Launches--
Delta Flight 259: The inaugural launch on August 26, 1998 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ended in failure, when software adapted from the Delta II caused a guidance failure during first-stage flight. The failure and subsequent vehicle motion depleted the hydraulic fluid used for steering. Upon loss of control, the vehicle was destroyed. The Galaxy 10 satellite (Hughes HS601 HP type) was destroyed.

Delta Flight 269: The second launch on May 4, 1999, carrying the Orion 3 satellite (Hughes HS601 model), also ended in failure. The second stage engine experienced a pressure anomaly and rupture, and shut down while its second burn was underway, leaving the payload in a useless orbit.

Delta Flight 280: The third and final flight on August 23, 2000 launched a 4,348 kg (9,586 lb) satellite simulator into a 180.76 √ó 20,694 km orbit. While the apogee was 2,710 km lower than the targeted 185 √ó 23,404 km, and somewhat a partial failure, it was within the allowable 3,000 km margin of error and demonstrated the propellant depletion shutdown capability of the DCSS, modified versions of which would become the second stage of the Delta IV.

            Ariane 6 is a launch vehicle developed and manufactured by 
            ArianeGroup under the authority of the European Space Agency 
            (ESA), with a first test flight scheduled for 2020 or, now 
            more likely, 2021. When development is completed, it will 
            become the newest member in the Ariane launch vehicle family. 
            The final design was selected in December 2014, favoring a 
            liquid-fuelled core with large solid rocket boosters over the 
            initial solid-fuel rocket design. The motivation for 
            Ariane 6 development was to replace Ariane 5 at half the cost, 
            and allow double the number of launches each year.

            Ariane 6 was initially conceived in the early 2010s as a 
            replacement launch vehicle for Ariane 5, and a number of 
            concepts and high-level designs were suggested and proposed 
            during 2012‚Äì2015. Funding from several European governments 
            was secured by early 2016, and contracts were signed to begin 
            detailed design and the build of test articles. While in 2019, 
            the maiden orbital flight had been planned for 2020, by May 
            2020, the planned initial launch date had been delayed until 2021.

Two variants of Ariane 6 are being developed:

Ariane 62, with two P120 solid boosters, will weigh around 530 tonnes (1,170,000 lbs) at liftoff and is intended mainly for government and scientific missions. It can launch up to 5,000 kg (11,000 lbs) into GTO and 10,350 kg (22,820 lbs) into LEO.

Ariane 64, with four P120 boosters, has a liftoff weight of around 860 tonnes (1,900,000 lbs) and is intended for commercial dual-satellite launches of up to 11,500 kilograms (25,400 lbs) into GTO and 21,500 kg (47,400 lbs) into LEO. Like Ariane 5, it will be able to launch two geosynchronous satellites together.

Ariane 6 comprises three major structural and propellant-carrying components.

            Tronador (Spanish for Thunderer) is a series of Argentine 
            rockets, including the Tronador I and Tronador II vehicles, 
            to develop a liquid-propellant rocket expendable launch 
            system called ISCUL (Inyector Satelital de Cargas Utiles 
            Ligeras, Light Useful Payloads Satellite Launcher).

            The Tronador I is an unguided liquid-fueled rocket used 
            for sub-orbital spaceflight test flights. Its development 
            led to the larger VEx test rocket, testing technologies 
            needed for the Tronador II, which has a guidance system 
            and would be capable of reaching low Earth orbit. 
            Development of the satellite launch vehicle has cost more 
            than 600 million dollars over several years.
            
Tronador III
The proposed Tronador III would have the same diameter as Tronador II, but would have a length of 34 metres (112 ft). The fueled rocket would weight 89 metric tons, and capable of delivering a ton of payload into polar orbit.

            The VLS-1 (Portuguese: Ve√≠culo Lan√ßador de Sat√©lites)
            was the Brazilian Space Agency's main satellite launch 
            vehicle. The launch vehicle was to be capable of 
            launching satellites into orbit. The launch site was 
            located at the Alc√¢ntara Launch Center due to its 
            proximity to the equator.

            Associated vehicles include the Sonda I, Sonda II, 
            Sonda III and Sonda IV, the VS-30, VS-40 and VSB-30.

            The VLS was cancelled after decades of development 
            and high expenditures with poor results and a failed 
            association with Ukraine that slowed the program 
            for years.

            VLS-1 development started in 1984, after the first 
            launch of the Sonda IV rocket. To date, three 
            prototypes have been built and two launches attempted, 
            departing from the Alc√¢ntara Launch Center. During 
            the V1 and V2 prototype launches (VLS-1 V1 and VLS-1 V2) 
            technical problems prevented mission success, but 
            allowed the testing of several vehicle components. 
            The V3 prototype exploded on the launch pad on 22 
            August 2003, two days before its intended launch date. 
            The 2003 Alc√¢ntara VLS accident caused a considerable 
            setback to the Brazilian space program. The V4 
            prototype was expected to be launched in 2016.

            The VLM (Ve√≠culo Lan√ßador de Microssat√©lites) is a 
            proposed three-stage satellite launcher being developed 
            by the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology 
            in collaboration with Germany. The project originated 
            in 2008 as a simplified version of the VLS-1 rocket, 
            using only the core stages.

            A version based on the S-50 rocket engine is being 
            developed, with the objective of launching satellites 
            of up to 150 kg into equatorial circular orbits at 
            300 km altitude.

            Development on VLM started in 2008 for the purpose of 
            low-cost and reliable launch of microsatellites. 
            Initially, a four-stage rocket using solid fuel was 
            proposed, arranged in the following order:

            Stage 1: S-43 rocket engine
            Stage 2: S-40TM rocket engine
            Stage 3: S-44 rocket engine
            Stage 4: S-33 rocket engine

            It was later decided in 2011 to build a precursor 
            single-stage rocket bearing a new engine called S-50. 
            The vehicle is being developed and its engine tested 
            in collaboration with the German Space Agency (DLR).
            This precursor test is called VS-50 and is planned for 
            launch in 2019. The VS-50 vehicle measures 12 m (39 ft) 
            long, 1.46 m (4 ft 9 in) in diameter, and has a mass of 
            about 15 tons.

            All launches are planned to take place from the Alc√¢ntara 
            Launch Center, located on Brazil's northern Atlantic coast.

            Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1) was small, solid fueled launch vehicle 
            based on the road mobile DF-21 IRBM with an additional 
            upper stage (in total 4 stages[1]). It was 13.6 meters 
            in length and 1.4 meters in diameter, with launch mass 
            of 20t. It was possible to launch KT-1 both from a 
            truck-based platform or from airborne platform. It had 
            a 100 kg to LEO payload capacity. It was possibly the 
            launch vehicle for a Chinese ASAT system that was tested 
            against an old Chinese weather satellite in 2007.

            The vehicle has performed two flights, the first in 15 
            September 2002 and the second 16 September 2003. The 
            first flight failed to place a 50 kg satellite into 
            polar orbit due to a second stage malfunction. The 
            second flight was also a failure, however Chinese 
            officials declared some success citing the guidance 
            systems, fairing separation and satellite-launcher 
            separation as successful. The second launch sent the 
            payload, PS-2 microsatellite (40 kg) into wrong orbit. 
            The satellite completed barely one orbit before 
            re-entering the atmosphere.

            The Kaituozhe-1 launcher appears to have been cancelled 
            after two unsuccessful launches. A third (in 2004) and 
            fourth launch have been rumored, but are not confirmed.

            The rocket had three variants: the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1), 
            the Kaituozhe-1A (KT-1A, originally designated KT-2, not 
            to be confused with KT-2 below) and the Kaituozhe-1B 
            (KT-1B, originally designated KT-2A, not to be confused 
            with KT-2A below). The rockets that flew were of the KT-1 
            variant. The KT-1A and KT-1B variant rockets were not built.

Kaituozhe-2
Like its predecessor the Kaituozhe-2 (KT-2) is a solid-fueled launch vehicle which could be based on the DF-31 missile. Two versions have been proposed:

Kaituozhe-2
The Kaituozhe-2 (KT-2, AKA Kaituo-2) features a possibly DF-31 based stage 1, topped by a smalled diameter stage 2 and 3. It has reportedly a payload of 800 kg to low earth orbit.

The maiden flight of the Kaituozhe-2 took place at 23:45 UTC on March 2, 2017 from Jiuquan (apparently from one of the two solid rocket launch pads. The rocket placed the Tiankun-1 (TK-1) satellite into polar orbit.

The KT-2 is a rapid-response launcher; the rocket is capable of mobile-launch from a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicle.

Kaituozhe-2A
The Kaituozhe-2A (KT-2A) features a possibly DF-31 based stage 1, augmented by two DF-21 based strap-on boosters. It features a stage 2 with the same diameter as the stage 1 and the same smaller diameter stage 3 as the Kaituozhe-2. It has reportedly a payload of 2000 kg to low earth orbit.

            Kuaizhou (KZ, Chinese: Âø´Ëàü; pinyin: ku√†izh≈çu, meaning 
            "speedy vessel" or "swift boat") (also called Feitian Emergency Satellite 
            Launch System, Feitian-1, FT-1) is a family of Chinese 
            "quick-reaction" orbital launch vehicles. Flying since 
            2013, Kuaizhou 1 and 1A consist of three solid-fueled rocket 
            stages, with a liquid-fueled fourth stage as part of the 
            satellite system. Kuaizhou 11, which flew an unsuccessful 
            maiden flight in July 2020, is a larger model able to launch 
            a 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lbs) payload into low Earth orbit. 
            Heavy-lift models KZ-21 and KZ-31 are in development. The 
            Kuaizhou series of rockets is manufactured by ExPace, a 
            subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation 
            (CASIC), as their commercial launch vehicles.

            The rocket series is based on CASIC's ASAT and BMD mid-course 
            interceptor rockets, in particular the DF-21 IRBM (another 
            Chinese rocket that was based on DF-21 was the Kaituozhe-1). 
            Development on the KZ rockets started in 2009. The KZ rockets
            were to provide an integrated launch vehicle system with the 
            rapid ability to replace Chinese satellites that might be 
            damaged or destroyed in an act of aggression in orbit. The 
            vehicle uses mobile launch platform. The rocket is operated 
            by the Chinese 2nd Artillery.

            The maiden flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 1 
            natural disaster monitoring satellite, occurred on 25 September 
            2013, launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            Second flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 2 natural 
            disaster monitoring satellite, was launched at 06:37 UTC on 21 
            November 2014, again from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

            The first commercial launch inaugurated the Kuaizhou 1A version 
            on 9 January 2017, from Jiuquan. It placed three small satellites 
            into a polar orbit.

            The Long March 1 (ÈïøÂæÅ‰∏ÄÂè∑), also known as the Changzheng-1 
            (CZ-1), was the first member of China's Long March rocket family.

            Development started in January 1965 after the Seventh Ministry 
            of Machinery Industry issued a design task. The two stage 
            liquid fueled DF-4 was modified by adding a third stage in 
            order to make it to the desired orbit. Long March 1's second 
            flight launched China's first satellite, Dong Fang Hong 1, to 
            space on April 24, 1970. The rocket was operational between 
            1970-1971. Wang Xiji was the chief designer of the rocket.

Also known as "Chang Zheng 1-D/CZ-1"

            Long March 1D was a member of China's Long March rocket 
            family. During the 1990s CALT developed an improved 
            version of the DF-4 to test the reentry vehicle warheads 
            of the DF-31. They took advantage of this 
            development and offered it as the Long March 1D for 
            commercial application. The modifications included:

            An DF-4 improved first stage, which used the new version 
            of the YF-2B, and switched propellants to UDMH/N2O4 for 
            improved performance. The replacement of the DF-4 second 
            stage motor YF-3A. The proposed replacement was the Long 
            March 4 third stage engine, the YF-40. A new inline 
            inter-stage would replace the existing tapered connector 
            between the second and third stages, which allowed for an 
            additional 70cm diameter to be added to the third stage 
            skirt. This would allow for the addition of RCS to the 
            third stage. A new third stage with a new motor, the FG-36 
            and an optional RCS. A new computer inertial guidance system 
            which enabled the third stage to be 3-axis stabilised for 
            added precision. The new design did not have a good reception 
            and was only used for reentry vehicle tests. It flew three 
            suborbital missions from Taiyuan LC-1 with two successes and 
            a failure on the final mission. The first launch was on 
            June 1, 1995 and the second one was in November 1997. The 
            final and failed launch was on January 3, 2002.

            Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit 
            medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by 
            SpaceX in the United States. It is powered by Merlin 
            engines, also developed by SpaceX, burning cryogenic 
            liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as 
            propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional 
            Star Wars spacecraft, the Millennium Falcon, and the 
            nine Merlin engines of the rocket's first stage. The rocket 
            evolved with versions v1.0 (2010‚Äì2013), v1.1 (2013‚Äì2016), 
            v1.2 "Full Thrust" (2015‚Äìpresent), including the Block 5 
            Full Thrust variant, flying since May 2018. Unlike most 
            rockets, which are expendable launch systems, since the 
            introduction of the Full Thrust version, Falcon 9 is 
            partially reusable, with the first stage capable of 
            re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after 
            separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved 
            for the first time on flight 20 with the v1.2 version in 
            December 2015.

            Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms 
            (50,300 lbs) to low Earth orbit, 8,300 kg (18,300 lbs) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) when expended, and 
            5,500 kg (12,100 lbs) to GTO when the first stage is 
            recovered. The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been 
            Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lbs), and Telstar 19V 
            with 7,075 kg (15,598 lbs). The latter was launched into a 
            lower-energy GTO orbit achieving an apogee well below the 
            geostationary altitude, while the former was launched into 
            an advantageous super-synchronous transfer orbit.

            In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) 
            contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services 
            (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space 
            Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first 
            mission under this contract launched on October 8, 2012. Falcon 
            9 has been human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the 
            ISS as part of the NASA Commercial Crew Development program. 
            Currently, Falcon 9 has been certified for the National Security 
            Space Launch[22] program and NASA Launch Services Program as 
            "Category 3", which can launch the priciest, most important, and 
            most complex NASA missions.

            Five rockets of the version 1.0 design were launched from June 2010 
            to March 2013. Version 1.1 conducted fifteen launches from September 
            2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version was in service from 
            December 2015 into 2018, with several additional upgrades within 
            this version. The latest variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 
            2018. It features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and 
            other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon 
            Heavy derivative, introduced in February 2018, consists of a 
            strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its center core, attached to 
            two standard Falcon 9 first stages used as boosters.

            The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch 
            vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived 
            from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened 
            Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional 
            Falcon 9-like first stages as strap-on boosters. The Falcon 
            Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently 
            operational launch vehicle, the third-highest capacity of 
            any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V and 
            Energia, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class 
            rocket ever launched successfully (behind the Saturn V and 
            Energia).

            SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 
            2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC). The rocket carried a Tesla
            Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, carrying a dummy 
            dubbed "Starman", as a dummy payload. The second Falcon Heavy 
            launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets 
            successfully returned to earth.[10] The third Falcon Heavy launch 
            successfully occurred on June 25, 2019. Since then, the Falcon 
            Heavy has been certified for the National Security Space Launch 
            program.

            The Falcon Heavy was designed to be able to carry humans into space 
            beyond low Earth orbit, although as of February 2018, SpaceX has 
            confirmed that they will not transport people on the Falcon Heavy, 
            nor pursue the human-rating certification process to transport NASA 
            astronauts. The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the 
            Starship launch system.

Atlas V is the fifth major version in the Atlas rocket family. It is an expendable launch system originally designed by 
Lockheed Martin, now being operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing.

Each Atlas V rocket consists of two main stages. The first stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine manufactured by 
RD Amross and burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The Centaur upper stage is powered by one or two US RL10 engine(s) 
manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne and burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. AJ-60A strap-on solid rocket 
boosters (SRBs) are used in some configurations and will be replaced by GEM-63 SRBs in the near future. The standard 
payload fairings are 4 or 5 meters in diameter with various lengths.

The Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services (LMCLS) as part of the US Air Force Evolved Expendable 
Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and made its inaugural flight on August 21, 2002. The vehicle operates from Space Launch Complex 
41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Space Launch Complex 3-E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LMCLS continued to market the 
Atlas V to commercial customers worldwide until January 2018, when ULA assumed control of commercial marketing and sales.

            The Space Launch System (SLS) is a super heavy-lift expendable 
            launch vehicle, which has been under development by NASA in the 
            United States since its announcement in 2011. It is the primary 
            launch vehicle of NASA's deep space exploration plans, including 
            the planned crewed lunar flights of the Artemis program and a 
            possible follow-on human mission to Mars. The SLS program has 
            replaced the Constellation program's Ares V launch vehicle program
            of 2005, which never left the development phase. SLS is intended 
            to replace the retired Space Shuttle as NASA's flagship vehicle. 
            Following the cancelation of the Constellation program, the NASA 
            Authorization Act of 2010 envisioned a single launch vehicle usable 
            for both crew and cargo. In 2013, SLS was projected to possibly be 
            the most capable super-heavy lift vehicle ever built.

            The initial variant of SLS, Block 1, was required by the US Congress 
            to lift a payload of 70 tonnes (69 long tons; 77 short tons) to low 
            Earth orbit (LEO), but it was later planned to exceed that requirement 
            with a rated payload capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons; 105 short 
            tons). As of 22 December 2019, this variant is planned to launch 
            Artemis 1, Artemis 2, Artemis 3, and Europa Clipper. The later Block 
            1B is intended to debut the Exploration Upper Stage and launch the 
            notional Artemis 4 through Artemis 7. Block 2 is planned to replace 
            the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and would 
            have a LEO capability of more than 130 tonnes (130 long tons; 140 short 
            tons), again as required by Congress.[ Block 2 is intended to enable 
            crewed launches to Mars. SLS is to have the world's highest-ever 
            total thrust at launch, but not the world's highest ever payload 
            mass. The SLS is planned to launch the Orion spacecraft and use the 
            ground operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center 
            in Florida.

--Vehicle description--
The SLS is a Space Shuttle-derived launch vehicle, with the first stage of the rocket being powered by one central core stage and two outboard boosters. The upper stage is being developed from the Block 1 variant to a Block 2 variant, the Exploration Upper Stage.

-Core stage-
The Space Launch System's core stage contains the Main Propulsion System (MPS) of the rocket. It is 65 metres (212 ft) long by 8.4 metres (27.6 ft) in diameter and fuels the four RS-25 rocket engines at its base. The core stage is structurally and visually similar to the Space Shuttle external tank, containing the liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. Initial flights are planned to use modified RS-25D engines left over from the Space Shuttle program. However, Space Shuttle main engines are reusable, so later flights are planned to switch to a different version of the engine not designed for reuse, as it will be cheaper.

The core stage is fabricated at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility and is common across all currently planned evolutions of the SLS to avoid the need for redesigns to meet varying requirements.

-Boosters-
SLS Booster test at Orbital ATK/Northrop Grumman's desert facility northwest of Ogden, Utah, March 2015
Block 1 and 1B boosters
Blocks 1 and 1B of the SLS are planned to use two five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). These new SRBs are derived from the four-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, with the addition of a center booster segment, new avionics, and lighter insulation. The five-segment SRBs provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the Shuttle SRB, but will no longer be recovered after use.

-Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension program-
The stock of SLS boosters is limited by the number of casings left over from the Shuttle program, since they modify flown boosters to add an additional segment. There are enough to last through eight flights of the SLS, but a replacement will be required for further flights. On 2 March 2019, the Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension (BOLE) program was announced. This program will use new solid rocket boosters built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems for further SLS flights. These boosters would be derived from the composite-casing SRBs in development for the OmegA launch vehicle, and are projected to increase Block 1B's payload to TLI by 3‚Äì4 tonnes, which is still 1 ton below the payload capacity of Block 2.

-Upper Stage-
ICPS - Block 1
The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) is planned to fly on Artemis 1. It is a stretched and human rated Delta IV 5 metres (16 ft) Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) powered by a single RL10B-2. Block 1 is intended to be capable of lifting 95 tonnes to LEO in this configuration if the ICPS is considered part of the payload. Artemis 1 is to be launched into an initial 1,800 by ‚àí93 kilometres (1,118 by ‚àí58 mi) suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. ICPS will then perform an orbital insertion burn at apogee and a subsequent translunar injection burn to send Orion towards the moon. The ICPS for Artemis 1 was delivered by ULA to NASA about July 2017, and was housed at Kennedy Space Centre as of November 2018. As of February 2020, ICPS (not EUS) is planned for Artemis 1, 2, and 3. ICPS will now be human-rated for the crewed Artemis-2 flight.

EUS - Block 1B and 2
The Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) is planned to fly on Artemis 4. Similar to the S-IVB, the EUS will complete the SLS ascent phase and then re-ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. It is expected to be used by Block 1B and Block 2, share the core stage diameter of 8.4 meters, and be powered by four RL10 engines.

--Program History--
During the joint Senate-NASA presentation in September 2011, it was stated that the SLS program had a projected development cost of US$18 billion through 2017, with US$10 billion for the SLS rocket, US$6 billion for the Orion spacecraft and US$2 billion for upgrades to the launch pad and other facilities at Kennedy Space Center. These costs and schedule were considered optimistic in an independent 2011 cost assessment report by Booz Allen Hamilton for NASA.

An internal 2011 NASA document estimated the cost of the program through 2025 to total at least $41 billion for four 95-tonne launches (1 uncrewed, 3 crewed), with the 130-tonne version ready no earlier than 2030.

The Human Exploration Framework Team (HEFT) estimated unit costs for Block 0 at US$1.6 billion and Block 1 at US$1.86 billion in 2010. However, since these estimates were made the Block 0 SLS vehicle was dropped in late 2011, and the design was not completed.

In September 2012, an SLS deputy project manager stated that US$500 million per launch is a reasonable target cost[clarification needed] for SLS.

In 2013, the Space Review estimated the cost per launch at US$5 billion, depending on the rate of launches. NASA announced in 2013 that the European Space Agency will build the Orion service module.

In 2011, NASA announced an "Advanced Booster Competition", to be decided in 2015, which would select whose boosters would be used for Block 2 of the SLS.

Several companies proposed boosters for this competition:

Aerojet, in partnership with Teledyne Brown, offered a booster powered by three new AJ1E6 LOX/RP-1 oxidizer-rich staged combustion engines, each producing 4,900 kN (1,100,000 lbf) thrust using a single turbopump to supply dual combustion chambers. On 14 February 2013, Aerojet was awarded a $23.3 million, 30-month contract to build a 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) main injector and thrust chamber.
Alliant Techsystems (ATK) proposed an advanced SRB nicknamed "Dark Knight", which would switch to a lighter composite case, use a more energetic propellant, and reduce the number of segments from five to four.
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Dynetics proposed a liquid-fueled booster named Pyrios.
In 2013, the manager of NASA's SLS advanced development office indicated that all three approaches were viable.

However, this competition was planned for a development plan in which Block 1A would be followed by Block 2A, with upgraded boosters. NASA canceled Block 1A and the planned competition in April 2014. Due to this cancellation, it was reported in February 2015 that SLS is expected to fly with the original five-segment SRB until at least the late 2020s. This decision was vindicated as a later study found that the advanced booster would have resulted in unsuitably high acceleration. The overly powerful booster would need modifications to Launch Pad 39B, its flame trench, and Mobile Launcher, which are being evaluated.

In August 2014, as the SLS program passed its Key Decision Point C review and entered full development, costs from February 2014 until its planned launch in September 2018 were estimated at US$7.021 billion. Ground systems modifications and construction would require an additional US$1.8 billion over the same time period.

In October 2018, NASA's inspector general reported that the Boeing core stage contract had made up 40% of the US$11.9 billion spent on SLS as of August 2018. By 2021, core stages were expected to have cost a total of US$8.9 billion, which is twice the initial planned amount.

In December 2018, NASA estimated that yearly budgets for SLS will range from US$2.1 to US$2.3 billion between 2019 and 2023.

In March 2019, the Trump Administration released its Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request for NASA. This budget did not include any money for the Block 1B and Block 2 variants of SLS. It was therefore uncertain whether these future variants of SLS will be developed, but congressional action restored this funding in the passed budget. Several launches previously planned for the SLS Block 1B are now expected to fly on commercial launcher vehicles such as Falcon Heavy, New Glenn, OmegA, and Vulcan. However, the request for a budget increase of US$1.6 billion towards SLS, Orion, and crewed landers along with the launch manifest seem to indicate support of the development of Block 1B, debuting Artemis 3. The Block 1B will be used mainly for co-manifested crew transfers and logistical needs rather than constructing the Gateway. An uncrewed Block 1B is planned to launch the Lunar Surface Asset in 2028, the first lunar outpost of the Artemis program. Block 2 development will most likely start in the late 2020s, after NASA is regularly visiting the lunar surface and shifts focus towards Mars.

In May 2019, NASA's Office of Audits reported that the SLS Block 1's marginal cost per launch is to be at least US$876 million. By comparison, a Saturn V launch cost roughly $1.23 billion in 2016 dollars. A letter from the White House to the Senate Appropriations Committee revealed that the SLS's cost per launch is estimated at "over US$2 billion" after development. NASA did not deny this cost and an agency spokesperson stated it "is working to bring down the cost of a single SLS launch in a given year as the agency continues negotiations with Boeing on the long-term production contract and efforts to finalize contracts and costs for other elements of the rocket".

Blue Origin submitted a proposal to replace the Exploration Upper Stage with an alternative to be designed and fabricated by the company, but it was rejected by NASA in November 2019 on multiple grounds. These included lower performance compared to the existing EUS design, unsuitability of the proposal to current ground infrastructure, and unacceptable acceleration in regards to Orion components.

            New Glenn, named after John Glenn, is a heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle 
            in development by Blue Origin. Design work on the vehicle began in 2012. 
            Illustrations of the vehicle, and the high-level specifications, were 
            initially publicly unveiled in September 2016. New Glenn is described as 
            a two-stage rocket with a diameter of 7 meters (23 ft). Its first stage 
            will be powered by seven BE-4 engines that are also being designed and 
            manufactured by Blue Origin.

            Like the New Shepard suborbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the 
            New Glenn's first stage is designed to be reusable. Originally intended 
            for first launch in 2020, by 2018 Blue Origin expected to launch New 
            Glenn in 2021, which remains the current target.

            After initiating the development of an orbital rocket system prior to 
            2012, and stating in 2013 on their website that the first stage would do 
            a powered vertical landing and be reusable, Blue Origin publicly announced 
            their orbital launch vehicle intentions in September 2015. In January 2016, 
            Blue Origin indicated that the new rocket would be many times larger than 
            New Shepard even though it would be the smallest of the family of Blue Origin 
            orbital vehicles. Blue Origin publicly released the high-level design of 
            the vehicle‚Äîand announced the name New Glenn‚Äîin September 2016.

H-IIA (H-2A) is an active expendable launch system operated by Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries (MHI) for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. These liquid 
fuel rockets have been used to launch satellites into geostationary orbit; lunar 
orbiting spacecraft; Akatsuki, which studied the planet Venus; and the Emirates 
Mars Mission, which was launched to Mars in July 2020. Launches occur at the 
Tanegashima Space Center. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. As of July 2020, H-IIA 
rockets were launched 42 times, including 36 consecutive missions without a 
failure, dating back to 29 November 2003.

Production and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on 1 April 2007. 
Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter SELENE, was the first H-IIA launched 
after this privatization.

The H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier H-II rocket, substantially redesigned to 
improve reliability and minimize costs. There have been four variants, with two 
in active service (as of 2020) for various purposes. A derivative design, the H-IIB, 
was developed in the 2000s and made its maiden flight in 2009.

            The Diamant rocket (Diamant is French for "diamond") was the 
            first exclusively French expendable launch system and at the 
            same time the first satellite launcher not built by either 
            the United States or USSR. As such, it has been referred to 
            as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher 
            projects.

            During 1962, development of the Diamant commenced as the 
            inaugural spacecraft project of France's space agency, the Centre 
            National d'√âtudes Spatiales (CNES). As a project, it was derived 
            from the military program Pierres pr√©cieuses (fr.: gemstones) that 
            included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis and 
            Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire), and drew heavily 
            upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously 
            developed. On 26 November 1965, the Diamant A performed its maiden 
            flight. Out of a total of 12 aunch attempts to be performed between 
            1965 and 1975, 9 of these were successful. Most notably, on 26 November 
            1965, the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French 
            satellite, named Ast√©rix.

            Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed, 
            designated A, B and BP4. All versions had three stages and a 
            payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit. Despite the 
            success of the Diamant as a launcher, France ultimately chose to 
            terminate further work on its national launcher program in favor 
            of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what 
            would become the Ariane launcher in 1975.

            OTRAG (German: Orbital Transport und Raketen AG, or Orbital Transport 
            nd Rockets, Inc.), was a German company based in Stuttgart, which in 
            the late 1970s and early 1980s planned to develop an alternative 
            propulsion system for rockets. OTRAG was the first commercial developer 
            and producer of space launch vehicles. The OTRAG Rocket claimed to 
            present an inexpensive alternative to existing launch systems through 
            mass-production of Common Rocket Propulsion Units (CRPU).

            OTRAG was founded in 1975 by the German aerospace engineer Lutz Kayser. 
            OTRAG's goal was to develop, produce, and operate a low cost satellite 
            launch vehicle. It was the first private company to attempt to launch a 
            private spacecraft. The OTRAG rocket was intended to be an inexpensive 
            alternative to the European rocket Ariane and the NASA Space Shuttle. 
            Kayser and a private consortium of six hundred European investors 
            financed the development and production of the OTRAG satellite launch 
            vehicle. Dr. Kurt H. Debus served as Chairman of the Board of OTRAG after 
            his retirement as director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and Dr. 
            Wernher von Braun served as scientific adviser to Kayser.

            In the face of doubts by Debus and von Braun, Kayser chose in 1975 to set 
            up testing and launch facilities in Shaba, Zaire (now Katanga Province in 
            the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Debus and von Braun were concerned 
            about the possibility of Zairian acquisition of missile technology from 
            the facilities. Kayser decided to proceed despite their opposition.

            Otrag's first test was on May 17, 1977, with the second successful launch 
            on May 20, 1978. The third test failed on June 5, with Zairian President 
            Mobutu Sese Seko watching the launch.

            Political pressure to halt the company's operations mounted quickly. 
            France and the Soviet Union were historically opposed to German 
            long-distance rocket development, and pressured the Zairian government 
            into closing down the development facility in 1979. Immediately afterwards, 
            Presidents Giscard d'Estaing of France and Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet 
            Union convinced the West German government to cancel the OTRAG project and 
            close down its German operations. In 1980, OTRAG moved its production and 
            testing facilities to a desert site in Libya. A series of successful tests 
            were conducted at this site beginning in 1981.

            OTRAG shut down in 1987. As the company left Libya, Muammar Gaddafi 
            confiscated all equipment and installations, hoping to later use the 
            technology, and German investors lost their money.

Design:

Various OTRAG rockets could be built up from the company's CRPUs (Common Rocket Propulsion Unit). A sounding rocket would bundle four or more CRPUs in parallel, topped with the payload. An orbital launcher would use dozens to hundreds of CRPUs, depending on payload mass. The launcher would then stage by dropping outer CRPUs, leaving the interior ones to continue with payload.

A CRPU was essentially a steel tube, 27 cm in diameter and 16 meters long, joined from a few shorter tubes. The CRPU was divided into three sections by aluminium bulkheads, with additional stiffening rings between bulkheads. Forward, the majority of the tube contained a mixture of nitric acid and nitrogen tetroxide oxidisers. Next was a section of kerosene fuel. This was commercial-grade kerosene, not the more expensive RP-1. Last was the engine section. A fuel line carried nitric acid around the kerosene, into the engine.

The design of the CRPU was extremely simple. The tubing was strong enough that the propellants were fed to the engine by pressure alone.
 This eliminated the need for turbopumps. The engine was ablatively cooled, eliminating the need for fine fuel passages and heat-resistant kerosene. The engine did not gimbal; instead, the vehicle was steered by throttling one side's CRPUs versus the opposite side. Thus, the engine was simply built into the tube walls, with the only mechanisms being the throttling valves. No separate pressurising system was included; the tanks were simply left with an ullage space, which was then filled with gas to a few hundred psi. Because of the narrow tubing, the bulkheads between sections could be simple plates, instead of domes like virtually all other rocket stages. There was no ignition system; instead, a slug of furfuryl alcohol was injected before the kerosene. The furfuryl alcohol ignited spontaneously upon contact with the nitric acid.

The use of ablative cooling, high-pressure steel construction, and large "empty" spaces meant that a CRPU was heavy, with relatively low performance. The diameter of the tubing also put a hard limit on the engine diameter, preventing use of an efficient, high-expansion nozzle for the upper stages. However, ganging CRPUs into three stages was sufficient to reach orbit. Meanwhile, the low cost of each CRPU, after the economies of scale gained by producing hundreds or possibly thousands of them per year, would have still left the vehicle cheaper than its contemporaries.

The company's baseline launcher design claimed to lift one metric ton to orbit. It would have consisted of a third stage core of four CRPUs, surrounded by a second stage of twelve CRPUs, in turn surrounded by the first stage's 48 CRPUs.
 Larger vehicles and capacities would be achieved with greater numbers of CRPUs, possibly including several hundred per flight for a heavy launcher.

The company forecast that CRPUs would eventually be so cheap, recovering and refurbishing a launcher would be no better than simply building more units.
The use of storable propellants and few moving parts meant that launch-site operations would also be very simple. These advantages were expected to overcome the disadvantages of small specific impulse and payload fraction.

Flight History:

The engines were tested extensively on ground rigs, on both German and African test sites. Experiments were run with varying fuel and oxidiser formulations, as the general design was quite robust.

Small, 4-unit vehicles were built and tested in Shaba North, Zaire and Seba Oasis, Libya, where heights of 20 to 50 kilometres were reached. The rockets used there were 6 and 12 meters long. The basic CRPU concept was shown to be workable, though some rockets experienced guidance or component failures. The last launch of an OTRAG rocket took place on September 19, 1983 in Esrange. Following this launch, the OTRAG rocket was to be used in high altitude research.

Political pressure then shut down the project, as discussed in the OTRAG article.

After the company had left Libya in 1987, some remaining equipment was confiscated by the government. However, enough parts and knowledge were missing to prevent Libya from continuing the project.

            The M-4S rocket (MU4S rocket) was developed by the Institute of Aeronautics 
            and Astronautics of the University of Tokyo (hereinafter referred to as the 
            University of Tokyo) jointly with the Nissan Motor Aerospace Division 
            (hereinafter referred to as the Nissan), manufactured by Nissan, and 
            operated by the University of Tokyo. It is a solid fuel rocket . 4 units 
            were launched from Uchinoura Space Center and 3 units succeeded. This 
            section also describes M-1, M-3D, which is a full-scale preliminary test 
            machine for M-4S.

            It was developed based on the technology of the L-4S rocket . All stages 
            consist of solid-fuel rockets that do not have a guidance device, and 
            carry out satellite orbit injection by the gravity turn method . Due to 
            the relationship with the launch launcher, the tail can not be installed 
            in the second stage, and after launch, the flare that opens like an 
            umbrella at the rear end of the second stage stabilizes the posture. 
            The tail area of the first stage is also smaller than that of 
            the L-4S relative to the rocket body. For this reason, the flight 
            stability is lower than that of the L-4S, but the probability of 
            satellite orbit injection can be secured by optimizing the orbit design 
            based on the thrust margin. Basically, each satellite of M-4S was 
            launched as a "target orbit" with all satellites near 700 km perigee 
            and 2500-4500 km apogee (apogee changes significantly depending on 
            satellite weight) (in this orbit) , Satellite orbits are most likely 
            to be established, even if swept by the wind, exceeding 95%). This is 
            the reason why the weights of all the satellites that are thrown in 
            are less than half of the low-orbit launch capability in the catalog.

            The first unit was launched on September 25, 1970 (Showa 45) , but 
            failed to put the satellite into orbit. Unit 4 from Unit 2 , 1971 
            in February from 1972 August was launched.

            The Europa rocket was an early expendable launch system of the European 
            Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), which was the precursor to the 
            European Space Agency (ESA). It was developed with the aim to delivering 
            space access technology, and more specifically to facilitate the 
            deployment of European-wide telecommunication and meteorological satellites 
            into orbit.

            The Blue Streak missile predated the Europa programme, having originally 
            been developed by Britain primarily for military purposes, however it was 
            cancelled in 1960. Efforts to repurpose the Blue Streak, such as the studied 
            Black Prince expendable launch system, eventually cumulated in the 
            multinational Europa programme.

            Workshare on the programme was shared between the various members of the ELDO 
            based upon their financial contributions. The Europa launcher itself 
            primarily consisted of the Blue Streak, Coralie, and Astris rocket stages.

            The programme proceeded to perform multiple test launches, however these 
            frequently resulted in partial failures. In addition, Britain decided to 
            pull out of the ELDO organisation, and thus Europa, to instead focus on 
            the rival British Black Arrow launcher instead. This led to the replacement 
            of the Blue Streak by the French-built Diamant section. However, confidence 
            in the programme had diminished due to the poor reliability figures, and this 
            led to its termination. While Europa was ultimately cancelled, the ambition 
            for such a launcher was still present and supported by the majority of ELDO 
            members and, following its reformation into the ESA in 1974, the agency 
            proceeded to develop the Ariane family of launchers, would which prove to be 
            a commercial success with hundreds of launches performed.

            Hermes was a proposed spaceplane designed by the French Centre National d'√âtudes 
            Spatiales (CNES) in 1975, and later by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was 
            superficially similar to the American Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar and the larger Space 
            Shuttle.

            In January 1985, CNES proposed to proceed with Hermes development under the 
            auspices of the ESA. Hermes was to have been part of a crewed spaceflight 
            program. It would have been launched using an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. In November 
            1987, the project was approved; it was to commence an initial pre-development phase 
            from 1988 to 1990, after which the authorisation to proceed to full-rate development 
            was to depend on the outcome of this phase. However, the project was subject to 
            numerous delays and funding issues around this period.
            
            In 1992, Hermes was cancelled. This was in part due to unachievable cost and 
            performance goals, as well as the formation of a partnership with the Russian 
            Aviation and Space Agency (RKA), which reduced the demand for an independent crewed 
            spaceplane. As a result, no Hermes shuttles were ever built. During the 2010s, it was 
            proposed to relaunch the Hermes vehicle to serve as a partially reusable air-launched 
            spaceplane launch system, known as SOAR.

            Vega (Italian: Vettore Europeo di Generazione Avanzata, meaning "Advanced generation 
            European carrier rocket"), is an expendable launch system in use by Arianespace 
            jointly developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the European Space Agency 
            (ESA). Development began in 1998 and the first launch took place from the Centre 
            Spatial Guyanais on 13 February 2012.

            It is designed to launch small payloads ‚Äî 300 to 2500 kg satellites for scientific 
            and Earth observation missions to polar and low Earth orbits. The reference Vega 
            mission is a polar orbit bringing a spacecraft of 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km.
            
            The rocket, named after Vega, the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, is a 
            single-body launcher (no strap-on boosters) with three solid rocket stages: the P80 
            first stage, the Zefiro 23 second stage, and the Zefiro 9 third stage. The upper 
            module is a liquid rocket called AVUM. The improved version of the P80 stage, the 
            P120C, will be used as the side boosters of the Ariane 6. Italy is the leading 
            contributor to the Vega program (65%), followed by France (13%). Other participants 
            include Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.
            
            During the mid-1990s, French firms A√©rospatiale and SEP, along with Italian firm 
            Bombrini-Parodi-Delfino (BPD), commenced discussions on the development of a proposed 
            Ariane Complementary Launcher (ACL). Around the same time, Italy began to champion the 
            concept of a new solid-propellant satellite launcher. This proposed launcher, dubbed 
            Vega, was promoted as functioning to expand the range of European launch capabilities; 
            Vega would be capable of launching a 1000 kg payload capability into a 700 km polar 
            orbit. From the onset, the first of three stages would be based on the solid booster 
            of the existing Ariane 5 expendable launch system while the second and third stages 
            would make use of the in-development Zefiro rocket motor.

            However, it was recognised to be a costly project and thus difficult for Italy alone 
            to finance; accordingly, international partners were sought early on in order to 
            proceed with development. In April 1998, it was publicly stated that the Vega 
            programme was dependent upon the securing of roughly ECU70 million of industrial 
            investment, as well as the availability of around ECU350 million of funding that 
            had been requested from interested member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), 
            led by France and Italy. During June 1998, it was announced that ministers from 
            European Space Agency (ESA) member states had agreed to proceed with the first phase 
            of the development programme for Vega; the participating members were France, Belgium, 
            the Netherlands, Spain and Italy - the latter had assumed 55% of the burden for 
            financing the programme.
            
            By September 1998, it was projected that, if fully funded, Vega would perform its first 
            launch during 2002. However, by early 1998, France was publicly showing displeasure in 
            the programme, leading to disputes in its funding. A new, higher-performance version of 
            the Vega was proposed, but this failed to sufficiently satisfy France. In September 1999, 
            France decided to withdraw from the Vega programme entirely, leading to fears for the 
            future of the launcher. In November 1999, European Space Agency (ESA) formally dropped 
            Vega as an endorsed programme, a decision which was largely attributed to France's 
            withdrawal; Italy declared that it would proceed regardless, and threatened to re-direct 
            its allocated contributions for the further development of the Ariane 5 to meet the 
            shortfall.
            
            Around 2000, an alternative use for the Vega was explored as a medium-class booster rocket 
            to be used in conjunction with an improved, up-rated model of the Ariane 5 heavy launcher. 
            In October 2000, it was announced that France and Italy had settled their year-long 
            dispute over the Vega programme; France and Italy agreed to provide 35% and 52%, respectively, 
            of the financing towards the all-composite P80 booster for the Ariane 5 ‚Äî work which would be 
            included in the Vega programme. In March 2001, FiatAvio and the Italian Space Agency formed 
            a new company, European Launch Vehicle (ELV), to assume responsibility for the majority of 
            development work on the Vega programme. By 2003, there was concerns that European Space 
            Agency (ESA)'s recent adoption of the Russian Soyuz launcher would directly compete with the 
            in-development Vega; demands for such launchers had declined with a downturn in the mobile 
            telecommunications satellite market and doubts over the European Galileo satellite 
            navigation system.

            The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV is a Small-lift launch vehicle, was a project 
            started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organisation to develop 
            the technology needed to launch satellites. SLV was intended to reach a height 
            of 400 kilometres (250 mi) and carry a payload of 40 kg (88 lbs). The first 
            experimental flight of SLV-3, in August 1979, was a failure. The first successful 
            launch took place on 18 July, 1980.

            It was a four-stage rocket with all solid-propellant motors.
            
            The first launch of the SLV took place in Sriharikota on 10 August 1979. The 
            fourth and final launch of the SLV took place on 17 April 1983.
            
            It has taken approximately seven years to realise the vehicle from start. The 
            solid motor case for first and second stage are fabricated from 15 CDV6 steel 
            sheets and third and fourth stages from fibre reinforced plastic.

            develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. 
            Its design was based on Satellite Launch Vehicle. ISRO did not have sufficient

            at the same time and the ASLV programme was terminated after the initial 
            developmental flights. The payloads of ASLV were Stretched Rohini Satellites.
            
            The ASLV was a five-stage vehicle. Two strap-on boosters acted as a first stage, 
            with the core stage igniting after booster burn out. The payload capacity of the 
            ASLV was approximately 150 kg (330 lbs) to an orbit of 400 km (250 mi) with a 
            47-degree inclination.

            At liftoff, the ASLV generated 909.9 kN (204,500 lbsf) of thrust. It was a 
            41,000-kilogram (90,000 lbs) rocket, measuring 23.5 metres (77 ft) in length with 
            a core diameter of one metre (3 ft 3 in).[4] The height to diameter ratio of ASLV 
            was very large which resulted in the vehicle being unstable in flight. This was 
            compounded by the fact that many of the critical events during a launch like the 
            core ignition and the booster separation happened at the Tropopause where the 
            dynamic loads on the launcher was at the maximum.
            
            The ASLV made four launches, of which one was successful, two failed to achieve 
            orbit, and a third achieved a lower than planned orbit which decayed quickly. 
            The type made its maiden flight on 24 March 1987, and its final flight on 4 May 1994.

                                -Variants-
            ISRO has envisaged a number of variants of PSLV to cater to different mission 
            requirements. There are currently two operational versions of the PSLV ‚Äî the 
            core-alone (PSLV-CA) without strap-on motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, with 
            six extended length (XL) strap-on motors carrying 12 tonnes of HTPB based 
            propellant each. These configurations provide wide variations in payload 
            capabilities up to 3,800 kg (8,400 lbs) in LEO and 1,800 kg (4,000 lbs) in 
            sun-synchronous orbit.
            
            PSLV-G (retired)
            The standard or "Generic" version of the PSLV, PSLV-G had four stages using 
            solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six strap-on motors 
            (PSOM or S9) with 9 tonne propellant loading. It had capability to launch 
            1,678 kg (3,699 lbs) to 622 km (386 mi) into sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C35
            was the last operational launch of PSLV-G before its discontinuation.
            
            PSLV-CA
            The PSLV-CA, CA meaning "Core Alone", model premiered on 23 April 2007. The 
            CA model does not include the six strap-on boosters used by the PSLV 
            standard variant but two SITVC tanks with Roll Control Thruster modules are 
            still attached to the side of the first stage with addition of two cylindrical 
            aerodynamic stabilizers. The fourth stage of the CA variant has 400 kg (880 lbs) 
            less propellant when compared to its standard version. It currently has 
            capability to launch 1,100 kg (2,400 lbs) to 622 km (386 mi) Sun synchronous 
            orbit.
            
            PSLV-XL
            PSLV-XL is the upgraded version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its 
            standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters
            with 12 tonne propellant load. Weighing 320 t (710,000 lbs) at lift-off, the 
            vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL or S12) to achieve higher payload 
            capability. On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version 
            of strap-on booster for the PSLV. The first use of PSLV-XL was the launch of 
            Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV C11. The payload capability for this variant is 1,800 kg 
            (4,000 lbs) to SSO.
            
            PSLV-DL
            PSLV-DL variant has only two strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load on 
            them. PSLV-C44 on 24 January 2019 was the first flight to use PSLV-DL variant of 
            Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
            
            PSLV-QL
            PSLV-QL variant has four ground-lit strap-on boosters, each with 12 tonnes of 
            propellant. PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first flight of PSLV-QL.
            
            
            PSLV C45 lift off (Concept)
            PSLV-3S was conceived as a three-staged version of PSLV with its six strap-on 
            boosters and second liquid stage removed. The total lift-off mass of PSLV-3S was 
            expected to be 175 tonnes with capacity to place 500 kg in 550 km low Earth orbit.

            Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is an expendable launch system 
            operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). GSLV was used in 
            thirteen launches from 2001 to 2018, with more launches planned. Even though
            GSLV Mk III shares the name, it is an entirely different launcher.

            The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) project was initiated in 
            1990 with the objective of acquiring an Indian launch capability for 
            geosynchronous satellites.

            GSLV uses major components that are already proven in the Polar Satellite 
            Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launchers in the form of the S125/S139 solid rocket 
            booster and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine. Due to the thrust required for 
            injecting the satellite in a GTO orbit the third stage was to be powered by a 
            LOX/LH2 Cryogenic engine which at that time India did not possess or had the 
            technology know-how to build one.

            The first development flight of the GSLV (Mk.I configuration) was launched on 
            18 April 2001 was a failure as the payload failed to reach the intended orbit 
            parameters. The launcher was declared operational after the second development 
            flight successfully launched the GSAT-2 satellite. During the initial years 
            from the initial launch to 2014 the launcher had a checkered history with 
            only 2 successful launches out of 7.

            Cryogenic Engine Controversy
            The third stage was to be procured from Russian company Glavcosmos, including 
            transfer of technology and design details of the engine based on an agreement 
            signed in 1991. Russia backed out of the deal after US objected to the deal 
            as in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) May 1992. As a 
            result, ISRO initiated the Cryogenic Upper Stage Project in April 1994 and 
            began developing its own cryogenic engine. A new agreement was signed with 
            Russia for 7 KVD-1 cryogenic stages and 1 ground mock-up stage with no technology 
            transfer, instead of 5 cryogenic stages along with the technology and design as 
            per the earlier agreement. These engines were used for the initial flights 
            and were named GSLV Mk.1.

            DIRECT was a late-2000s proposed alternative super heavy lift launch vehicle 
            architecture supporting NASA's Vision for Space Exploration that would replace 
            the space agency's planned Ares I and Ares V rockets with a family of Shuttle-
            Derived Launch Vehicles named "Jupiter".

            DIRECT was advocated by a group of space enthusiasts who asserted that they 
            represented a broader team of dozens of NASA and space industry engineers who 
            actively worked on the proposal on an anonymous, voluntary basis in their spare 
            time. In September 2008, the DIRECT Team was said to consist of 69 members, 62 
            of whom were NASA engineers, NASA-contractor engineers, and managers from the 
            Constellation Program. The small number of non-NASA members of the team 
            publicly represented the group.

            The project name "DIRECT" referred to a philosophy of maximizing the re-use of 
            hardware and facilities already in place for the Space Shuttle program (STS), 
            hence a "direct" transition. The DIRECT Team asserted that using this approach 
            to develop and operate a family of high-commonality rockets would reduce costs
            and the gap between retirement of the Space Shuttle and the first launch of 
            Orion, shorten schedules, and simplify technical requirements for future US 
            human space efforts.

            Three major versions of the DIRECT proposal were released with the last, 
            Version 3.0, unveiled in May 2009. On 17 June 2009, the group presented its 
            proposal at a public hearing of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans 
            Committee, a panel reviewing US space efforts, in Washington D.C.

            With the October 11th signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (S. 3729) 
            by President Obama mandating work on the Space Launch System Heavy Lift Launch 
            Vehicle, the DIRECT Team declared their effort a success and disbanded. Some 
            members subsequently announced the formation of a new space technology 
            company: C-Star Aerospace, LLC.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Jupiter Launch Vehicle Family

            DIRECT advocated developing a single, high-commonality family of rockets named 
            Jupiter, adapted closely from existing Space Shuttle systems. Each Jupiter 
            launch vehicle would use a "common core stage" consisting of a tank structure 
            based closely on the existing Space Shuttle External Tank with a pair of 
            standard four-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) mounted at the sides as on 
            the Space Shuttle. Up to four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) from the Space 
            Shuttle Orbiter would be attached to the bottom of the External Tank. The engines 
            would be deorbited along with the expended tank to burn up in the Earth's 
            atmosphere.

            Crews would be carried atop the launch vehicle in NASA's planned Orion Crew 
            Exploration Vehicle, itself topped by the planned Launch Abort System. Cargo, 
            whether carried behind the Orion spacecraft or alone on a cargo-only launch 
            would be enclosed by a payload fairing.

            Many configurations of Jupiter were seen as possible, but the DIRECT version 
            3.0 proposal, released in May 2009, recommended two: the Jupiter-130 and 
            Jupiter-246, with claimed lift capacities exceeding 70 and 110 tonnes, 
            respectively, to low Earth orbit.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Proposed Missions

            Low Earth Orbit and Uncrewed Scientific Missions

            Orion spacecraft taking a Space Shuttle Payload Delivery Module (SSPDM) to the 
            ISS, carrying an airlock, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and other cargo on a 
            single Jupiter-130. DIRECT asserted that the extra payload capability of the 
            Jupiter-130 would allow for a range of additional cargo payloads to be flown 
            with each Orion crew, a capability which is not possible with the Ares I. The 
            team suggested a number of extra missions which would be enabled by Jupiter in 
            their proposal, including:

            -New ISS resupply missions with the three ESA/ASI-built Multi-Purpose Logistics
            Modules
            -Performing more Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions with Orion crews
            -Launching massive new space telescopes over 8 meters in diameter (more than 
            3 times the diameter of Hubble)
            -Perform a Mars Sample Return mission on a single Jupiter launcher, to land 
            on Mars and return a sample of its soil back to Earth for study as early 
            as 2013
            -Launching a human crew to fly around the moon as early as 2013

            The DIRECT team asserted that these additional new missions could have been 
            planned and funded due to development cost savings with the Jupiter rocket 
            family compared to the current NASA baseline. They suggested that the proposed 
            new missions and payloads could provide useful employment for many people who 
            were working in the Space Shuttle program.

            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Origins and History

            DIRECT's Jupiter vehicle would have been an "in-line" Space Shuttle-derived 
            launch vehicle. This broad category of Space Shuttle adaptations, postulated 
            since before the first Shuttle launch, removes the winged Space Shuttle Orbiter, 
            moves the liquid main engines to the bottom of the cryogenic tankage (typically 
            proposed to be adapted from the Shuttle external tank), and relocates the payload 
            to above the tankage.

            The first official study of the concept was conducted in 1986 by NASA's Marshall 
            Space Flight Center in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. It 
            was promoted as one of the alternatives for launching uncrewed cargo and would 
            have potentially allowed a restarted lunar program as well. There were, however, 
            no funds available to NASA for building any new vehicles while the Space Shuttle 
            program continued. The idea was shelved and NASA concentrated on fixing and 
            operating the Space Shuttle instead.

            DIRECT's approach had a resemblance to that of the 1991 National Launch System 
            effort. Proposed jointly by NASA and the Department of Defense as an alternative 
            to the Titan IV, the design was based on the same solid rocket boosters and 
            modified external tank, but instead of the reusable Space Shuttle main engine, 
            specified four of the proposed disposable, less expensive Space Transportation 
            Main Engines. The United States Congress did not appropriate funding for the 
            development. A great deal of reference material exists in the public domain 
            regarding NLS.

            NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) of 2005 included a similar 
            design to the DIRECT proposal using three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME). 
            Known as LV-24 in crew launch form, and LV-25 in cargo configuration, the idea 
            was dismissed because it did not have sufficient performance for the proposed 
            lunar program - however the concept was not considered using an Earth departure 
            stage (EDS).

            DIRECT's re-exploration of the SDLV idea began in 2006 in frustration with the 
            high cost and delays of Ares I and worries that any similar issues with the giant 
            Ares V might put the whole Constellation Program in jeopardy. An additional goal 
            was to maintain US ability to launch crews to space with as short a gap as 
            possible after the planned retirement of Shuttle.

            The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), also referred 
            to as the Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3), is a three-stage medium-lift launch 
            vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Primarily 
            designed to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit,[16] it is 
            also identified as launch vehicle for crewed missions under the Indian Human 
            Spaceflight Programme and dedicated science missions like Chandrayaan-2. The GSLV 
            Mk III has a higher payload capacity than the similarly named GSLV Mk II.

            After several delays and a sub-orbital test flight on 18 December 2014, ISRO 
            successfully conducted the first orbital test launch of GSLV Mk III on 5 June 2017 
            from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Andhra Pradesh.

            In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved ‚Çπ43.38 billion (US$610 million) to build 
            10 GSLV Mk III rockets over a five-year period.

            GSLV Mk III launched CARE, India's space capsule recovery experiment module, 
            Chandrayaan-2, India's second lunar mission and will be used to carry Gaganyaan, 
            the first crewed mission under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme.

            ISRO initially planned two launcher families, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle 
            for low Earth orbit and polar launches and the larger Geosynchronous Satellite 
            Launch Vehicle for payloads to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The vehicle 
            was reconceptualized as a more powerful launcher as the ISRO mandate changed. 
            This increase in size allowed the launch of heavier communication and multipurpose 
            satellites, future interplanetary exploration and will be human rated to launch 
            crewed missions. Development of the GSLV Mk III began in the early 2000s, with the 
            first launch planned for 2009‚Äì2010. The unsuccessful launch of GSLV D3, due to a 
            failure in the cryogenic upper stage, delayed the GSLV Mk III development program. 
            The GSLV Mk III, while sharing a name with the GSLV, it features different systems 
            and components.

The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (or SSLV) is a small-lift launch vehicle being developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with payload capacity to deliver 500 kg to Low Earth orbit (500 km) or 300 kg to Sun synchronous orbit (500 km) for launching small satellites, with the capability to support multiple orbital drop-offs. On 21 December 2018, the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba completed the design for the vehicle.

The maiden flight is expected in 2020, and all flights will launch from a dedicated launch pad in Sriharikota called Small Satellite Launch Complex (SSLC). A new spaceport, under development, near Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu (as of December 2019) will handle SSLV launches when complete.

After entering the operational phase, the vehicle's production and launch operations will be done by a consortium of Indian firms along with New Space India Limited.

The SSLV was developed with the aim of launching small satellites commercially at drastically reduced price and higher launch rate as compared to PSLV. The manufacturing cost of the SSLV is expected to be ‚Çπ30 crore (US$4.2 million) to ‚Çπ35 crore (US$4.9 million). 

The projected high launch rate relies on largely autonomous launch operation and on overall simple logistics. To compare, a PSLV launch involves 600 officials while SSLV launch operations would be managed by a small team of about six people. The launch readiness period of the SSLV is expected to be less than a week instead of months. The launch vehicle can be assembled both vertically like the existing PSLV and GSLVs and horizontally like the decommissioned SLV and ASLV.

The first three stages of the vehicle use solid propellant, with a fourth stage being a velocity-trimming module.

RLV-TD is India's first uncrewed flying testbed developed for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration Programme. It is a scaled down prototype of an eventual two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) reusable launch vehicle.

The RLV-TD successfully completed its first atmospheric test flight on 23 May 2016, which lasted for 770 seconds and reached a maximum altitude of 65 kilometres (40 mi). It was designed to evaluate various technologies, and development of the final version is expected to take 10 to 15 years. The fully developed RLV is expected to take off vertically like a rocket, deploy a satellite in orbit, return to Earth, and land on a runway.

RLV-TD was developed by ISRO under the RLV Technology Demonstration Programme. The Technology Demonstration Programme consists of development of hypersonic rocket with air-breathing engines and the reusable launch vehicle.

In January 2012, the design of ISRO's reusable launch vehicle was approved by the "National Review Committee" and clearance was granted to build the vehicle. The vehicle was named "Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator" (RLV-TD). ISRO aims to bring down the cost of payload delivery to low Earth orbit by 80% from existing $20,000/kg to $4,000/kg.

The RLV-TD was developed with an objective to test various aspects such as hypersonic flight, autoland, powered cruise flight, hypersonic flight using the air-breathing engine propulsion and "Hypersonic Experiment". A series of four RLV-TD test flights are planned by ISRO: HEX (Hypersonic Flight Experiment), LEX (Landing Experiment), REX (Return Flight Experiment), and SPEX (Scramjet Propulsion Experiment).

A team of 750 engineers at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, National Aeronautical Laboratory, and Indian Institute of Science worked on the design and development of RLV-TD and the associated rocket. RLV-TD underwent 120 hours of wind tunnel, 5,000 hours of computational fluid dynamics and 1,100 runs of flight simulation tests. RLV-TD has mass of 1.75 tonnes, wingspan of 3.6 meters and overall length of 6.5 meters (excluding the rocket). The vehicle had 600 heat-resistant tiles on its undercarriage and it features delta wings and angled tail fins. Total cost of the project was ‚Çπ95 crore (equivalent to ‚Çπ110 crore or US$15.4 million in 2019). Future planned developments include testing an air-breathing propulsion system, which aims to capitalise on the oxygen in the atmosphere instead of liquefied oxygen while in flight.


Hypersonic Flight Experiment
RLV-TD HEX-01
The Hypersonic Flight Experiment (HEX), first of the five test flights was conducted on 23 May 2016. The Sub-orbital test flight was launched at 07:00 IST (01:30 GMT) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota (80 kilometres (50 mi) north of Chennai). The test flight lasted for 770 seconds, reached maximum altitude of 65 kilometres (40 mi) and covered a distance of 450 kilometres (280 mi) Sriharikota, steered itself to an on-target splashdown to land (ditch) at a designated spot in the Bay of Bengal. Not designed to float, the vehicle disintegrated on impact with water and was not recovered.

RLV-TD was mounted on top of and launched aboard a single stage solid fuel booster (HS9 booster) that was derived from strap-on boosters flown on India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. By the time, the booster consumed its solid propellant in 91 seconds, the RLV-TD separated from its boost stage and peaked to a sub-orbital altitude of about 65 kilometres (40 mi). The heat shield, guidance, navigation and control algorithms were tested at hypersonic speed by accurately steering the vehicle during the descent stage. For the descent back, the test vehicle was programmed to pitch its nose up, exposing silica tiles on its underside and reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon nose cap to the airflow into the thick lower layers of the atmosphere. The RLV-TD endured high temperatures of descent through the atmosphere due to its thermal protection system.

All stages of the test flight were tracked by ground station at the launch site and a shipborne terminal. All the mission objectives were met and technologies like autonomous navigation, guidance and control, reusable thermal protection system and descent mission management were successfully validated.


Future developments
The second experiment in RLV-TD series (LEX) would be an air-drop test where the prototype will be equipped with landing gear to perform an autonomous landing on a runway. The RLV-TD is being designed and built at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. Its navigational equipment was supplied by the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit in Thiruvananthapuram and ISRO's Satellite Applications Centre in Ahmedabad. The RLV-TD's landing gear was supplied by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. ISRO plans to carry out the landing experiment (LEX) on a military runway at Challakere in Chitradurga district. The flight article will be carried to an altitude of 3 km by a helicopter and released to land autonomously at the airstrip. LEX is scheduled for mid 2020.

In other experiments, ISRO intends to carry out an orbital re-entry experiment (REX) and a Scramjet Propulsion Experiment (SPEX) using a reusable carrier vehicle. ISRO Chief K. Sivan stated that the agency had many experiments planned for the RLV-TD, but would only focus on them from 2019, as it was occupied with other missions.

The Unified Launch Vehicle (ULV) is a development project by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) whose core objective is to design a modular architecture that could eventually replace the PSLV, GSLV Mk I/II and GSLV Mk III with a single family of launchers. The design may include a heavy-lift variant dubbed HLV, consisting of the SC-160 stage and two solid rocket boosters, as well as a super heavy-lift variant called SHLV with a cluster stage of five SCE-200 engines . As SCE-200 will only fly after the successful completion of the Gaganyaan program, the launcher will not fly before 2022.

As of May 2013, based on ISRO data, the design comprised a common core and upper stage, with four different booster sizes. All four versions of the boosters are solid motors, with at least three versions reusing current motors from the PSLV, GSLV Mk I/II and LVM3. The core, known as the SC160 (Semi-Cryogenic stage with 160 tonnes of propellant, in the ISRO nomenclature), would have 160,000 kg (350,000 lbs) of Kerosene / LOX propellant and be powered by a single SCE-200 rocket engine. The upper stage, known as the C30 (Cryogenic stage with 30 tonnes of propellant) would have 30,000 kg (66,000 lbs) of LH2 / LOX propellant and be powered by a single CE-20 engine.

The four booster options are:

6 √ó S-13, slightly larger than the S-12 on PSLV, to burn longer;
2 √ó S-60, which appears to be a new solid motor development;
2 √ó S-139, which is the first stage of PSLV and GSLV Mk I/II;
2 √ó S-200, like on the LVM3.

Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle(HLV-Variant):

A potential heavy-lift variant (HLV) of the unified launcher capable of placing up to 10 ton class of spacecrafts into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit would include:[1][12][10]

A larger dual S-250 solid strap-on boosters as compared to the S-200 boosters used in LVM3;
A L-400 semi-cryogenic core stage, with 400 tonnes of propellant, using a cluster of five SCE-200 engine's;
A L-27 cryogenic third stage, with 27 tonnes of propellant, using CE-20 engine.

            Ariane 1 was the first rocket in the Ariane family of expendable launch 
            systems. It was developed and operated by the European Space Agency 
            (ESA), which had been formed in 1973, the same year that development 
            of the launch had commenced.

            Ariane 1 was the first launcher to be developed with the primary 
            purpose of sending commercial satellites into geosynchronous orbit. 
            Crucially, it was designed with the ability of sending a pair of 
            satellites into orbit on a single launcher, thus reducing costs. As 
            the size of satellites grew, Ariane 1 quickly gave way to the more 
            powerful Ariane 2 and Ariane 3 launchers, which were heavily based 
            upon the original rocket. The Ariane 4 was the last rocket to 
            heavily draw upon the Ariane 1, as the successive Ariane 5 having 
            been developed using a far greater level of all-new elements.
            
            In 1973, eleven European countries decided to pursue joint 
            collaboration in the field of space exploration and formed a new 
            pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, the European 
            Space Agency (ESA). For some time prior to the ESA's formation, 
            France had been lobbying for the development of a new European 
            expendable launch system to serve as a replacement for the Europa 
            rocket; one proposed successor in the form of a refined Europa, 
            referred to as the Europa IIIB, was studied but was found to be 
            too ambitious and costly. As a result, the Europa IIIB proposal
            was scaled back and soon reemerged as the L3S. Multinational effort 
            became a quick focus point for the L3S proposal; early on, emphasis
            was placed upon cooperation on the initiative between Germany and 
            France, while increasing contribution from other countries also 
            came into the picture over time.

            In January 1973, Willy Brandt, the Chancellor of Germany, formally 
            agreed to the L3S project following a series of personal approaches 
            by Georges Pompidou, the President of France. On 21 September 1973, 
            the legal agreement for the L3S, was signed. Under this agreement, 
            the Europa III was formally cancelled, while the L3S would be 
            developed as a multinational project. From the onset, the launcher 
            was to be developed for the purpose of sending commercial satellites 
            into geosynchronous orbit, unlike many other competing launchers, 
            which had been typically developed for other purposes and subsequently 
            adapted, such as ballistic missiles. Development of L3S was seen as a 
            crucial test for the ESA, the fortunes of the former being viewed as 
            being highly indicative for the future of the latter. According to 
            author Brian Harvey, L3S was "one of the major European engineering 
            projects in the last quarter of the century".
            
            France was the largest stakeholder in the L3S programme; French 
            aerospace manufacturer A√©rospatiale served as the prime contractor 
            and held responsibility for performing the integration of all 
            sections of the vehicle, while French engine manufacturer Soci√©t√© 
            Europ√©enne de Propulsion (SEP) provided both the first and second 
            stage engines (the third stage engines were produced by Air Liquide 
            and German aerospace manufacturer MBB). Other major companies 
            involved included the French electronics firm Matra, Swedish 
            manufacturer Volvo, and German aircraft producer Dornier Flugzeugwerke. 
            The United Kingdom, which held a stake of 2.47 per cent in the project, 
            provided the guidance system, developed by Ferranti, and the central 
            digital computer, from Marconi; British Aerospace had later involvement 
            and workshare as well. Early on, it was felt that the L3S designation 
            lacked public appeal; out of several alternative names, including 
            Phoenix, Lyra, Ganymede and Vega, French minister of industrial and 
            scientific development Jean Charbonnel chose the name Ariane for the 
            new launcher.

            Ariane 2 was an expendable space launch vehicle, operated by the 
            European Space Agency (ESA) between 1986 and 1989 as part of 
            Ariane family of rockets. The principal manufacturer for the 
            Ariane 2 was A√©rospatiale, while the lead agency for its 
            development was the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), 
            the French government's space agency.

            Development of the Ariane 2 was authorised in July 1979, months 
            prior to the Ariane 1's first flight. Drawing heavily upon both 
            the design and infrastructure of the Ariane 1, the new launcher 
            was concurrently developed alongside the Ariane 3, with which it 
            shared much of its design. It represented an advancement of the 
            Ariane 1 rather than a replacement, but was capable of lifting
            even heavier payloads into Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). 
            Developed largely within a two year window, the Ariane 2 
            performed its maiden flight on 31 May 1986, actually flying 
            after its Ariane 3 sibling. During its brief service life, the 
            final launch of the Ariane 2 having been conducted on 2 April 
            1989, the Ariane family had become increasingly commercially 
            competitive, becoming the market leading heavy launch vehicle 
            in the world by the late 1980s.
            
            In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in 
            the field of space exploration and formed a new pan-national 
            organisation to undertake this mission, the European Space Agency. 
            Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival of a capable 
            European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 
            1 launcher was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Centre 
            at Kourou, French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered 
            to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival 
            platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United States of 
            America. However, even prior to the launcher having entering 
            service, there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved 
            derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads 
            than Ariane 1 could. These desires would result in the creation 
            of both the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3.

            While the initiative was first proposed in 1978, prior to the 
            Ariane 1's first flight, approval to commence the first phase 
            of development was not received until July 1979. The bulk 
            of development work on the new launcher occurred between 1980 
            and 1982. The Ariane 2 was designed to satisfy the future 
            demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a 
            Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). According to aerospace 
            historian Brian Harvey, in spite of the numbering sequence 
            adopted, the Ariane 3 was the direct successor to the Ariane 1, 
            rather than the Ariane 2, as could be logically assumed. The 
            principal agency behind the development of the Ariane 2 was 
            the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), while the lead 
            company for its production was the French aerospace 
            manufacturer A√©rospatiale.
            
            In order to keep costs down, CNES directed that only tested 
            technologies could be implemented in the launcher's 
            improvements; in fact, no budget was provided for new test 
            series to be performed. Furthermore, it was restricted to 
            using the existing launch pad and handling facilities 
            established for the Ariane 1, and that there was to be no 
            allowance for retooling of the Ariane production line. 
            However, one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted 
            was the establishment of tracking equipment in the Ivory 
            Coast; the existing infrastructure based in Brazil used by 
            the Ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased 
            performance of the Ariane 2, which flew a different ascent 
            profile than its predecessor. Performance boosts were 
            achieved via several different ways, such as the elongated 
            third stage fuel tanks to carry 30 percent more fuel, 
            elevated combustion pressure in multiple stages, a new 
            intertank structure that supported the addition of solid-fuel 
            boosters, and the adoption of a new fuel mixture.
            
            The finalised Ariane 2 is largely identical to its sibling, 
            the Ariane 3, the only major difference being the lack of 
            additional solid rocket boosters, which gave the Ariane 3 a 
            higher payload capacity at a greater unit cost. The payload 
            capacity of the Ariane 2 was 2,175 kilograms (4,795 lbs) to a 
            geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), exceeding that of the
            preceding Ariane 1.

            Ariane 2. Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP strap-on booster rockets 
            were used to augment the first stage at liftoff. The core of the Ariane 3 was 
            essentially identical to that of the Ariane 2. The first stage was powered by 
            four Viking 2B bipropellant engines, burning UH 25 (25% straight hydrazine, 
            75% UDMH) in a dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser. The second stage was powered by 
            a Viking 4B, which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination. The third stage 
            used a cryogenically fuelled HM7B engine, burning liquid hydrogen in liquid 
            oxygen. On some flights, a Mage 2 kick motor was flown as a fourth stage. One 
            atypical modification for the era was the revised satellite deployment system, 
            which could facilitate the launch of two smaller satellites as well as one 
            larger one.
            
            The Ariane 3's design heavily influenced that of its successor, the Ariane 4; 
            while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a 
            launcher, one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth 
            engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3. However, this was determined 
            to have involved a very high level of redesign work; an alternative approach was 
            instead adopted, in which the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of 
            propellant instead of the 145 tonnes present on the Ariane 3. While the second 
            and third stages of the Ariane 4 remained identical to the Ariane 3, a range of 
            strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, designed to gradually 
            increase the rocket's payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 15 per cent 
            smaller than the Ariane 3. It was effectively an improved and developed 
            derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, primarily differing through the application 
            of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters, the latter being the only 
            all-new design feature of the Ariane 4.

            The Ariane 4 was an expendable space launch system, developed by the Centre 
            national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES), the French space agency, for the European 
            Space Agency (ESA). It was manufactured by ArianeGroup and marketed by 
            Arianespace. Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight 
            on 15 February 2003, it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 total launches.

            In 1982, the Ariane 4 program was approved by ESA. Drawing heavily upon the 
            preceding Ariane 3, it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering 
            heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of 
            the Ariane family. The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing 
            technologies used, as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos; this 
            approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members, who funded and 
            participated in its development and operation. Capable of being equipped with a 
            wide variety of strap-on boosters, the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an 
            extremely versatile launcher.
            
            Once in service, the launcher soon became recognized for being ideal for 
            launching communications and Earth observation satellites, as well as those used 
            for scientific research. During its working life, the Ariane 4 managed to capture 
            50% of the market in launching commercial satellites, soundly demonstrating 
            Europe's ability to compete in the commercial launch sector. In February 2003, 
            the final Ariane 4 was launched; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in 
            favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5, which effectively replaced it in service.
            
            In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space 
            exploration and formed a new pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, 
            the European Space Agency (ESA). Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival 
            of a capable European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 1 
            launcher was successfully launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais at Kourou, 
            French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive 
            launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United 
            States of America, and it was quickly followed by improved derivatives in the form of 
            the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3. By early 1986, the Ariane 1, along with the Ariane 2 and 
            Ariane 3, had become the dominant launcher on the world market.

            In January 1982, the ESA issued its authorisation for the development and construction 
            of the Ariane 4; the development programme had the stated objective of increasing the 
            usable payload by 90%. The Ariane 4 would be a considerably larger and more 
            flexible launcher that the earlier members of its family, being intended to compete 
            with the upper end of launchers worldwide. In comparison, while the Ariane 1 had a 
            typical weight of 207 tonnes and could launch payloads of up to 1.7 tonnes into orbit; 
            the larger Ariane 4 had a typical weight of 470 tonnes and could orbit payloads of up 
            to 4.2 tonnes. Work on the Ariane 4 was substantially eased via drawing heavily on both 
            the technology and experiences gained from producing and operating the earlier members 
            of the Ariane rocket. The total development cost for the Ariane 4 was valued at 476 
            million European Currency Units (ECU) in 1986.
            
            Posed with the requirement to produce a rocket with substantially greater thrust, the 
            design team considered various approaches to achieve this. One concept studied had 
            involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3, 
            but was found to involve a very high level of redesign work to achieve this; instead, 
            the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of propellant instead of the 145 
            tonnes present on the Ariane 3. While the second and third stages remained identical to 
            the Ariane 3, a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, 
            designed to gradually increase the rocket's payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 
            15% smaller than the Ariane 3.
            
            In effect, the Ariane 4 was an improved and developed derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, 
            primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled 
            boosters, the latter being the only all-new design feature of the Ariane 4; at this 
            point, the practice of using liquid boosters was uncommon, having only previously been 
            used in the Chinese space program. Another innovation of the Ariane 4 was the dual-launch 
            SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe de Lancement Double Ariane) fairing. This had the 
            function of allowing a pair of satellites, one placed on top of the other; several different 
            SPELDA nose fairings could be installed, including normal and extended models. The SPELDA 
            was considerably lighter than its predecessor; the guidance system also used much more 
            accurate ring laser gyroscopes. According to aviation author Brian Harvey, the advances 
            present in the design of the Ariane 4 represented a conservative and evolutionary, rather 
            than revolutionary, philosophy.

Ariane 5 is a heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and operated 
by Arianespace for the European Space Agency (ESA). It is launched 
from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. It has been used to 
deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth 
orbit (LEO). A direct successor system, Ariane 6, is in development 
as of July 2020.

The system was originally designed as an expendable launch system by 
the Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES), the French government's 
space agency, in close cooperation with Germany and other European 
partners. Despite not being a direct derivative of its predecessor 
rocket program, it is classified as part of the Ariane rocket family. 
Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, 
leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. ESA 
originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the Hermes spaceplane, and thus 
it is rated for human space launches.

Since its first launch, Ariane 5 has been refined in successive 
versions: "G", "G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES". The system 
has a commonly used dual-launch capability, where up to two large 
geostationary belt communication satellites can be mounted using a 
SYLDA (Syst√®me de Lancement Double Ariane, "Ariane Double-Launch System") 
carrier system. Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible 
depending on size using SPELTRA (Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement 
Triple Ariane, "Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure"). Up to 
eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or minisatellites, 
can be carried with an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads) platform.

As of August 2020, Arianespace had signed contracts for Ariane 5 ECA launches 
up through 2023, approximately two years following the planned introduction 
of Ariane 6 in early 2021.

-Variants-
G: The original version is dubbed Ariane 5 G (Generic) and had a launch mass 
of 737 tonnes. Its payload capability to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) 
was 6,900 kilograms (15,200 lbs) for a single satellite or 6,100 kilograms 
(13,400 lbs) for dual launches. It flew 17 times with one failure and two 
partial failures.

G+: The Ariane 5 G+ had an improved EPS second stage, with a GTO capacity 
of 7,100 kilograms (15,700 lbs) for a single payload or 6,300 kilograms 
(13,900 lbs) for two. It flew three times in 2004, with no failures.

GS: At the time of the failure of the first Ariane 5 ECA flight in 2002, 
all Ariane 5 launchers in production were ECA versions. Some of the ECA 
cores were modified to use the original Vulcain engine and tank volumes 
while the failure was investigated; these vehicles were designated 
Ariane 5 GS. The GS used the improved EAP boosters of the ECA variant 
and the improved EPS of the G+ variant, but the increased mass of the 
modified ECA core compared to the G and G+ core resulted in slightly 
reduced payload capacity. Ariane 5 GS could carry a single payload of 
6,600 kilograms (14,600 lbs) or a dual payload of 5,800 kilograms 
(12,800 lbs) to GTO. The Ariane 5 GS flew 6 times from 2005 to 2009
    with no failures.

ECA: The Ariane 5 ECA (Evolution Cryotechnique type A), first 
successfully flown in 2005, uses an improved Vulcain 2 first-stage 
engine with a longer, more efficient nozzle with a more efficient 
flow cycle and denser propellant ratio. The new ratio required length 
modifications to the first-stage tanks. The EPS second stage was 
replaced by the ESC-A (Etage Sup√©rieur Cryog√©nique-A), which has a 
dry weight of 2,100 kilograms (4,600 lbs) and is powered by an HM-7B
engine burning 14,000 kilograms (31,000 lbs) of cryogenic propellant. 
The ESC-A uses the liquid oxygen tank and lower structure from the 
Ariane 4's H10 third stage, mated to a new liquid hydrogen tank. 
Additionally, the EAP booster casings were lightened with new welds 
and carry more propellant. The Ariane 5 ECA has a GTO launch capacity 
of 9,100 kilograms (20,100 lbs) for dual payloads or 9,600 kilograms 
(21,200 lbs) for a single payload.

ES: The Ariane 5 ES (Evolution Storable) has an estimated LEO launch 
capacity of 21,000 kilograms (46,000 lbs). It includes all the 
performance improvements of Ariane 5 ECA core and boosters but 
replaces the ESC-A second stage with the restartable EPS used on Ariane 5 
GS variants. It was used to launch the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) 
into a 260 km circular low Earth orbit inclined at 51.6¬∞ and has been 
used 3 times to launch 4 Galileo navigation satellites at a time directly 
into their operational orbit. The Ariane 5 ES flew 8 times from 2008 to 
2018 with no failures.

ME: The Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) was under development until 
the end of 2014. The last ESA ministerial council of December 2014 has 
cut further funding for Ariane 5 ME in favour of developing Ariane 6. 
Last activities for Ariane 5 ME were completed at the end of 2015. 
Activities on development of the VINCI upper stage were transferred 
to Ariane 6.

M-3C rocket (Mu 3 SC Rocket), the University of Tokyo Aerospace Research Institute (after the Ministry of Education Institute of Space and Astronautical Science , currently the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, below, The University of Tokyo) is Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Aerospace Division (A three-stage solid fuel rocket for launching a scientific satellite developed jointly with Nissan, manufactured by Nissan, and operated by the University of Tokyo.)

Development was carried out using the L-4SC rocket (five launch vehicles) with the L-4S added with a guidance control device. The first stage and the third stage are non-guided, and only the second stage is guided by the liquid jet TVC and side jets.

Initially, it was planned to be developed as a 4-stage M-4SC, but it has been changed to a 3-stage type to simplify the guidance system. In the days of unguided M-4S rockets , perigee 700 km, apogee 2500 km to 4500 km (apogee varies greatly depending on the satellite weight) in order to realize reliable satellite orbital launch even if it is blown by wind. I had no choice but to launch a satellite as a "target orbit." For this reason, only the desired satellites could be manufactured according to the orbit set by the rocket, and only satellites that were significantly smaller than the actual low-orbit launch capability could be put into orbit. However, the M-3C can freely select the orbit considering the purpose and size of the satellite, and the size of the satellite that can be inserted into the orbit is larger than that of the M-4S. In addition, the launch capability itself has been slightly improved over the M-4S due to advances in rocket fuel technology.

The M-3C and M-3H rockets have many similarities in structure, and they are considered together as the second generation of the Mu rocket . Since the M-3C needed to launch a substitute for the satellite that failed to launch, it remained even after the M-3H appeared, and as a result, the M-3H ended earlier in operation.

It is often misunderstood that the M-3C rocket, M-3H rocket , M-3S rocket , and M-3SII rocket are guidance-controlled rockets, but the flight maneuver is similar to the L-4S rocket and M-4S rocket. This is the gravity turn method . The guidance control device mounted on these rockets merely corrects the deviation between the ideal flight path and the actual path set in advance by the launcher for the control in the vertical plane. After the combustion of the first stage and the second stage that flew according to the ideal path defined by the launcher was completed, the attitude was controlled by the side jet of the second stage and the spin was added by the spin motor to the third stage Flies inertially in a parabola, and starts combustion near its apex (Thrust error up to the second stage is corrected by controlling the launch direction and combustion start time of the third stage). It is from the MV rocket that the ISAS satellite launch rocket began to actively change the flight path in the vertical in-plane direction

The M-3H rocket (Mu3H) is manufactured by the Japan Aerospace Research Institute of the University of Tokyo (later the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science , Ministry of Education , now Space Aerospace Research Institute, hereinafter the University of Tokyo), Nissan Motor Aerospace Division. A three-stage solid fuel rocket for launching a scientific satellite that was jointly developed with (Nissan), manufactured by Nissan, and operated by the University of Tokyo.

The first stage of the M-3C rocket was extended to increase the launch capability. The final letter "C" of the M-3C is an acronym for "Control", which means guidance, whereas the final alphabet "H" of this rocket is taken from the acronym for "High Performance."

M-3C and M-3H have a lot in common in the structure, and both are considered together as the second generation of the Mu rocket. The M-3C was left behind after the M-3H appeared because it had to launch an alternative to the satellite that failed to launch, and as a result, the M-3H ended earlier in operation.

Electron is a two-stage orbital expendable launch vehicle (with an optional third stage) developed by Rocket Lab, an American aerospace company founded in New Zealand. Electron was developed to service the commercial small satellite launch market. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital class rocket.

In December 2016, Electron completed flight qualification. The first rocket was launched on 25 May 2017, reaching space but not achieving orbit due to a glitch in communication equipment on the ground. During its second flight on 21 January 2018, Electron reached orbit and deployed three CubeSats. The first commercial launch of Electron, and the third launch overall, occurred on 11 November 2018.

Electron uses two stages with the same diameter (1.2 m, 3 ft 11 in) filled with RP-1/LOX propellant. The main body of the rocket is constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.

Both stages use the innovative Rutherford rocket engine, the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital rocket. The electric pumps are powered by Li-Polymer batteries. The second stage uses three batteries which are "hot swapped", two of the batteries are jettisoned once depleted to shed mass. There are nine Rutherford engines on the first stage and one vacuum-optimized version on the second stage.[20][21][22] The first stage engines deliver 162 kN (36,000 lbf) of force and the second stage delivers 22 kN (4,900 lbf) of force. Almost all of the engines' parts are 3D printed to save time and money in the manufacturing process.

Rocket Lab has also developed an optional third stage designed to circularize the orbits of its satellite payloads. The stage also puts satellites into a more accurate orbit in less time. This "kick" stage employs a new rocket engine, named Curie, that is capable of performing multiple burns, uses an unspecified "green" bipropellant, and is 3D printed. It was first used during Electron's second flight. The "kick" stage can transport up to 150 kg (330 lb) of payload.

Another third stage design, called 'Photon', is being developed to inject small payloads up to 30 kg (66 lb) into lunar orbit.

Production
Manufacturing the carbon composite components of the main flight structure has traditionally required 400 hours, with extensive hand labor in the process. In late 2019, Rocket Lab brought online a new robotic manufacturing capability to produce all composite parts for an Electron in just 12 hours. The robot was nicknamed "'Rosie' the Robot", after The Jetsons character. The process can make all the carbon fiber structures, as well as handle cutting, drilling, and sanding such that the parts are ready for final assembly. The company objective as of November 2019 is to reduce the overall Electron manufacturing cycle to just seven days.

Rutherford engine production makes extensive use of additive manufacturing and has since the earliest flights of Electron. This allows the capability to scale production in a relatively straightforward manner by increasing the number and capability of 3D printers.

The Electron initially had a payload capacity of 150 to 225 kg (330 to 495 lb) to a 500 km (310 mi) 500 km (310 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit.[6][35]

In pursuit of reusability Rocket Lab has made changes to Electron. Flight 6 and 7 ("That's a Funny Looking Cactus" and "Make it Rain") had instruments on the first stage needed to gather data to help with the reflight program. Flight 8 ("Look Ma No Hands") had Brutus, an instrument that collected data from the first stage to study reentry and was designed to be able to survive splashdown in the ocean.

Flight 10 ("Running out Fingers") had a block update to the first stage of the Electron to allow the first guided reentry of the first stage booster. Updates included additional hardware for guidance and navigation; onboard flight computers; and S-Band telemetry to both gather and livestream data gathered during reentry. The first stage also had a reaction control system (RCS) to orient the booster. After, stage separation the first stage using the new hardware installed flipped 180¬∞ to prepare for reentry. Throughout the reentry the stage was guided though the atmosphere such that it has the right orientation and angle of 
attack for the base heat shield to protect the booster from destruction using RCS and onboard computers. The booster successfully survived its guided re-entry despite having no deceleration hardware onboard and destructively splashed down into the ocean at 900 km/h (560 mph) as planned if reentry was successful. Rocket Lab had no plans to recover the stage and instead wanted to demonstrate the ability to successfully reenter. Flight 11 ("Birds of a Feather") again successfully demonstrated similar success. No further atmospheric reentry tests similar to flight 10 and 11 are expected.

Following flight 11 in mid-February 2020 low altitude tests were done to test parachutes. In April 2020 Rocket Lab shared the successful demonstration of mid-air retrieval done in March 2020. An Electron test article was dropped by a helicopter and deployed its parachutes. A helicopter carrying a long-boom snagged a drogue line from the parachute at 1,500 m (5,000 ft) demonstrating a successful retrieval. Following the catch the test article was brought back to land.

Flight 17 will demonstrate a parachute full recovery with a splashdown into the ocean.

In August 2020 Rocket Lab announced increased payload of Electron to 225 to 300 kg (495 to 660 lb). The payload capacity increase was mainly due to battery advancements. The increased payload capacity allows offset of mass added by recovery technology. In addition, more payload mass could be flown on interplanetary missions and others when Electron is expended. Rocket Lab also announced expanded fairings with a 1.8 m (5.9 ft) diameter, larger than the standard 2.5 m (8.2 ft) long and 1.2 m (3.9 ft) in diameter fairings.

Electron is designed to launch a 150 to 225 kg (330 to 495 lb) payload to a 500 km (310 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. In October 2018 Rocket Lab opened a factory large enough to produce more than 50 rockets per year according to the company. Customers may choose to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which can be easily attached to the rocket shortly before launch. The price for delivering up to 150 kg to a 500 km Sun-synchronous orbit is about $6 million per launch, which offers the only dedicated service at this price point.

Moon Express contracted Rocket lab to launch lunar landers (multiple launches contracted, some planned for Moon Express operations after GLXP) on an Electron to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize (GLXP). None of the contenders met the prize deadline, and the competition was closed without a winner. For sometime after the closure of GLXP, the Moon Express Electron launches remained scheduled, but before February 2020, all the launches of Moon Express using Electron were canceled.

            Variants:
            Angara 1.2 - The smallest Angara under development is the Angara 1.2, which consists 
            of one URM-1 core and a modified Block I second stage. It has a lift-off mass of 171 
            tons and can deliver 3.8 tons of payload to a 200 km x 60¬∞ orbit.
            
            Angara A5 - The second Angara developed was the Angara A5 heavy lift launch vehicle, 
            which consists of one URM-1 core and four URM-1 boosters, a 3.6m URM-2 second stage, 
            and an upper stage, either the Briz-M or the KVTK. Weighing 773 tonnes at lift-off, 
            Angara A5 has a payload capacity of 24.5 tonnes to a 200 km x 60¬∞ orbit. Angara A5 
            is able to deliver 5.4 tons to GTO with Briz-M, or 7.5 tons to the same orbit with 
            KVTK.

            In the Angara A5, the four URM-1s used as boosters operate at full thrust for 
            approximately 214 seconds, then separate. The URM-1 forming the vehicle's core is 
            operated at full thrust for lift off, then throttled down to 30% to conserve 
            propellant. The core is throttled back up after the boosters have separated and 
            continues burning for another 110 seconds.

            The first Angara A5 test flight was on 23 December 2014.
            
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            The Angara rocket family is a family of space-launch vehicles being developed by the 
            Moscow-based Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center. The rockets are 
            to put between 3,800 and 24,500 kg into low Earth orbit and are intended, along with 
            Soyuz-2 variants, to replace several existing launch vehicles.
            
            After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many formerly Soviet launch vehicles were 
            built in or required components from companies now located in Ukraine, such as Yuzhnoye 
            Design Bureau, which produced Zenit-2, and Yuzhmash, which produced Dnepr and Tsyklon. 
            Additionally, the Soviet Union's main spaceport, Baikonur Cosmodrome, was located in 
            Kazakhstan, and Russia encountered difficulties negotiating for its use. This led 
            to the decision in 1992 to develop a new entirely Russian launch vehicle, named Angara, 
            to replace the rockets now built outside of the country, and ensure Russian access to 
            space without Baikonur. It was decided that this vehicle should ideally use the 
            partially completed Zenit-2 launch pad at the Russian Plesetsk spaceport, and be able 
            to launch military satellites into geosynchronous orbit, which Proton could not due to 
            lack of a launch pad at Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Several companies submitted bids for the 
            new rocket, and in 1994 Khrunichev, the developer of Proton, was selected as the 
            winner. The commercial success of Proton over the next two decades would be an 
            advantage to Khrunichev, as the Angara project immediately ran into funding 
            difficulties from the cash-strapped Russian government.

            Khrunichev's initial design called for the use of a modified RD-170 for first stage 
            propulsion and a liquid hydrogen powered second stage. By 1997, the hydrogen-powered 
            second stage had been abandoned in favor of kerosene, and the RD-170 was replaced 
            with a modular design which would be powered by the new RD-191, a one-chamber engine 
            derived from the four-chamber RD-170. In late 1997 Khrunichev was given approval 
            from the Russian government to proceed with their new design, which would both be 
            able to replace the ICBM-based Dnepr, Tsyklon, and Rokot with its smaller variants, 
            as well as be able to launch satellites into geostationary orbit from Plesetsk with 
            the Proton-class Angara A5. This new modular rocket would require construction 
            of a new launch pad.
            
            By 2004, the design of Angara had taken shape and the project proceeded with development 
            of the launchers. In 2008, NPO Energomash, the builder of the RD-191, reported that the 
            engine had completed development and burn tests and was ready for manufacturing and 
            delivery, and in January 2009 the first completed Angara first stage was delivered to 
            Khrunichev. The next year Vladimir Nesterov, Director-General of Khrunichev, announced 
            that the first flight test of Angara would be scheduled for 2013, and in 2013 the first 
            prototype Angara rocket arrived in Plesetsk.
            
            In 2014, 22 years after Angara's original conception, the first launch took place on 
            July 9, a suborbital test flight from the northern Plesetsk Cosmodrome. An Angara A5 was 
            launched into geosynchronous orbit in December 2014.
            
            In June, 2020, it was reported that the first Angara Launching Pad was completed and 
            would be transported to Vostochny Cosmodrome.

The Zenit-3SLB or Zenit-3M is a Ukrainian expendable carrier rocket derived from the Zenit-2SB. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets, which were designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. It is a modified version of the Zenit-3SL, designed to be launched from a conventional launch pad rather than the Sea Launch Ocean Odyssey platform.

Launches of Zenit-3SLB rockets are conducted from Site 45/1 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Commercial launches are conducted by Land Launch, and use the designation 3SLB, whilst launches conducted by Roskosmos or the Russian Space Forces will use the designation 3M.

It consists of a Zenit-2SB (Zenit-2M) core vehicle, with a Block DM-SLB upper stage. The first launch of a Zenit-3SLB occurred on 28 April 2008, carrying the Israeli AMOS-3 satellite. This was also the first commercial Zenit launch from Baikonur since a failed Globalstar launch in 1998, and the first launch to be conducted by the Land Launch consortium.

The Dnepr rocket (Ukrainian: –î–Ω—ñ–ø—Ä–æ, romanized: Dnipr√≥; Russian: –î–Ω–µ–ø—Ä, romanized: Dnepr) was a space launch vehicle named after the Dnieper River. It was a converted ICBM used for launching artificial satellites into orbit, operated by launch service provider ISC Kosmotras. The first launch, on April 21, 1999, successfully placed UoSAT-12, a 350 kg demonstration mini-satellite, into a 650 km circular Low Earth orbit.

--History--
The Dnepr was based on the R-36MUTTH Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ‚Äì called the SS-18 Satan by NATO ‚Äì designed in the 1970s by the Yuzhnoe Design Bureau in Dnipro, Ukraine, which was then a part of the USSR.

The Dnepr control system was developed and produced by the JSC "Khartron", Kharkiv. The Dnepr was a three-stage rocket using storable hypergolic liquid propellants. The launch vehicles used for satellite launches have been withdrawn from ballistic missile service with the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces and stored for commercial use. A group of a total of 150 ICBMs were allowed under certain geopolitical disarmament protocols to be converted for use, and can be launched through 2020. The Dnepr was launched from the Russian-controlled Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Dombarovsky launch base, near Yasny, in the Orenburg region of Russia.

In February 2015, following a year of strained relations as a result of a Russian military intervention into Ukraine, Russia announced that it would sever its "joint program with Ukraine to launch Dnepr rockets and [was] no longer interested in buying Ukrainian Zenit boosters, deepening problems for [Ukraine's] space program and its struggling Yuzhmash factory." However ISC Kosmotras reported that they would continue to fulfill its obligations for three Dnepr launches in 2015, of which only one took place.

By the end of 2016, no further launch had materialized and the remaining customers had switched to alternative launch providers.

--Performance--
The Dnepr launch vehicle had only a small number of modifications compared to the R-36M ICBM in service. The main difference was the payload adapter located in the space head module and modified flight-control unit. This baseline version could lift 3,600 kg into a 300 km low earth orbit at an inclination of 50.6¬∞, or 2,300 kg to a 300 km sun-synchronous orbit at an inclination of 98.0¬∞. On a typical mission the Dnepr deployed a larger main payload and a secondary payload of Miniaturized satellites and CubeSats.

            The Al-Abid(Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿ®ÿØ‚Äé) LV was an Iraqi three-stage "Satellite launch system", a 
            civilian project that was commenced in 1988. The Iraqis intended to launch an 
            Al-Ta'ir satellite with the help of such a launch vehicle. The Iraqis therefore 
            pursued a LV with stages based on Scud missiles and the S-75 Dvina. However only the 
            first stage could be tested on December 1989 and according to General Ra'ad the next 
            stages could not be developed. General Ra'ad says that not even the drawings of the 
            second and third stage vehicles are available and that no final report could be 
            produced. UN inspectors and U.S intelligence did not offer many details regarding the 
            Al-Abid launch vehicle as they were not interested in it.
            
            In 1988 Iraq declared a program to design as well as manufacture a LV capable of putting 
            a satellite into orbit. The project was entirely civilian and was to be carried 
            under the supervision of MIMI and had scientists from the Space Research Centre(SRC) and 
            Project 144. A special team consisting of foreign scientists was also made which 
            UNMOVIC could not identify. In general the Al-Abid project drew a large amount of 
            foreign expertise particularly from a Brazilian scientist Major General Hugo de Oliveira 
            Piva. A 50 kg satellite had already been built by Iraqi scientists. The task was to prepare 
            a Launch vehicle capable of putting a 100-300 kg payload in 200-500 km LEO which was to be 
            developed from indigenous systems, namely Scud missiles. The SRC had planned for a schedule 
            to have the first launch by 12 December 1990. When it comes to the first stage various 
            designs and configurations of the Scud missiles were studied including cluster configurations 
            involving four, five or six Scud missiles or modified Scud missiles were studied and similar 
            opinions regarding higher stages were also discussed. By early 1989 Iraqi scientists 
            had concluded on a design of five modified Scud missiles for first stage, a separated 
            modified Scud as second stage and a double base propellant for third stage, in February 
            1989 the other team of two foreign specialist proposed a different design with a 
            single Scud missile as core stage of first stage with 4-8 strap-on rockets which could 
            be Scuds or S-75 Dvinas, the second stage would be either liquid propelled or solid 
            propelled and would include an AKM, the space research centre would reject this design. 
            Initially focus was concentrated on the first-stage however work on second and third 
            stages had already commenced, initially the second stage was a 880 mm Scud missile of 
            extended burn-time however by beginning on 1989 diameter increased to 1250 mm. Initially 
            the missile had a large payload but General Ra'ad who oversaw Iraq's missile program had 
            the width of the third stage increased to 1.25 m to avoid this hammerhead shape. The 
            Iraqis would then also declare to develop a first-stage rocket engine with four Scud 
            combustion chambers and a single turbopump which would fit a 1250 mm rocket and could 
            operate DETA/UDMH as fuel however work on this would be cancelled after the Gulf War.

Shavit 2 (Hebrew: "comet" ‚Äì ◊©◊ë◊ô◊ò) is a small lift launch vehicle produced by Israel from 1982 onwards, to launch satellites into low Earth orbit. It was first launched on 19 September 1988 (carrying an Ofek-1 satellite payload), making Israel the eighth nation to have an orbital launch capability after the USSR, United States, France, Japan, People's Republic of China, United Kingdom, and India.

The Shavit 2 project is believed to have been an offshoot development, resulting from Israel's Jericho nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program.

Shavit rockets are launched from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over the Mediterranean Sea to prevent debris coming down in populated areas and also to avoid flying over nations hostile to Israel to the east; this results in a lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow. The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage, and is manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI).

The Republic of South Africa produced and tested a licensed version in cooperation with Israel called the RSA-3 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to produce a domestic satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile; the South African program was closed in 1994.

An earlier unrelated project called Shavit 2 was the first Israeli sounding rocket, launched on 5 July 1961 for meteorological research. Shavit Three, with an altitude reported as 100 miles (160 km), was launched on 11 August 1961.

--Development--
The development of Shavit 2 began in 1982.[8] Shavit was a three-stage, solid-propellant launcher designed to carry payloads up to 250 kg into low Earth orbit. It was speculated for some time and later confirmed that the first two stages of the Shavit were that of the Jericho II missile.

Shavit was first launched in 1988 and because of its geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, Israel had to launch it to the west, over the Mediterranean Sea, in order to avoid flying over those hostile territories to its east. The practice has continued ever since.[

--Vehicle description--
The first of the Shavit vehicles were a small, 3-stage, solid-propellant booster based on the 2-stage Jericho-II ballistic missile and developed under the general management of Israel Aircraft Industries and in particular its MBT System and Space Technology subsidiary. Israel Military Industries Systems produces the first-stage and second-stage motors, while Rafael is responsible for the third-stage motor.

A planned commercial Shavit upgrade was called Next. This name is no longer used, and this proposed upgrade configuration is now called Shavit-2. Both first and second stages of the Shavit-2 use the stretched motor design of the Shavit-1 first stage.

--Launch history--
The Shavit has been launched 11 times, placing the payload into orbit 9 times. On the 4th and 6th flights, the vehicle failed before reaching space. Most non-Israeli satellites are launched eastward to gain a boost from the Earth's rotational speed. However, the Shavit is launched westward (retrograde orbit) over the Mediterranean Sea to avoid flying and dropping spent rocket stages over populated areas in Israel and neighboring Arab countries. The Shavit is also said to be made available for commercial launches in the near future.

            Firefly Alpha (Firefly Œ±) is a two-stage orbital expendable launch vehicle developed 
            by the American aerospace company Firefly Aerospace to cover the commercial small 
            satellite launch market. Alpha is intended to provide launch options for both full 
            vehicle and ride share customers.
            
            Alpha was initially designed with a first stage powered by an FRE-2 engine, which 
            consisted of twelve nozzles arranged in an aerospike configuration. The engine used 
            methane, as opposed to RP-1. The second stage was to be propelled by the FRE-1 engine, 
            which used a conventional bell nozzle. It was intended to launch 400 kg to low Earth 
            orbit.

            After Firefly's corporate reorganization, Alpha was redesigned. The vehicle now uses 
            two stages, both 1.8 m in diameter, filled with RP-1/LOX propellant. The main body of 
            the rocket is constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.
            
            Alpha's first stage is powered by four Reaver 1 LOX / RP-1 engines, delivering 736.1 kN 
            (165,500 lbsf) of thrust. The second stage is powered by one Lightning 1 LOX / RP-1 engine, 
            delivering 70.1 kN (15,800 lbsf) of thrust. Lightning 1 was test-run for nearly 5 minutes 
            on March 15, 2018 during a long duration test fire. The engine was fired at Firefly's 
            Test Stand 1 in Briggs, Texas.
            
            The Alpha airframe uses all carbon-fiber composite material in its construction. Use of 
            denser materials like titanium and aluminum results in a heavier airframe which requires 
            more fuel to launch, making the carbon-fiber body more fuel efficient.
            
            In March 2018, Firefly said that the development of Alpha was expected to cost approximately 
            $100 million. The company is also developing a future rocket, Firefly Beta, which initially 
            consisted of three Alpha cores strapped together. However, in October 2019, Firefly announced 
            in partnership with Aerojet Rocketdyne, that it will now be a single core rocket powered by 
            Rocketdyne's AR1 engine.
            
            
            Alpha is designed to launch a 1,000 kg payload to a 200 km low Earth orbit, or a 600 kg payload 
            to a 500 km Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. Primary 
            payloads can be integrated by themselves or with a secondary payload, with capacity for up to 
            6 CubeSats. This allows Firefly's customers to have a dedicated small-satellite launcher, 
            reducing the issues of ride-sharing payloads and secondary payloads. These smaller satellites 
            can have an orbit that is not determined by a larger payload and can launch on their own 
            schedule instead of waiting on the readiness of all other payloads.
            
            In 2015 NASA's Launch Services Program awarded Firefly Aerospace a $5.5 million Venture Class 
            Launch Services contract to develop Alpha to enable easier access to the small satellite market.
            
            Firefly Aerospace plans to use a Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) to integrate payloads.
            
            Alpha is also intended to be a direct American competitor in the small satellite market to 
            India's PSLV, as they believe its ride-share capability in the market threatens US domestic 
            launchers.

            Antares (/√¶nÀàt…ëÀêriÀêz/), known during early development as Taurus II, is an expendable 
            launch system developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation (now part of Northrop Grumman)
            and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau to launch the Cygnus spacecraft to the International 
            Station as part of NASA's COTS and CRS programs. Able to launch payloads heavier 
            than 8,000 kg (18,000 lbs) into low-Earth orbit, Antares is currently the largest 
            rocket operated by Northrop Grumman. Antares launches from the Mid-Atlantic Regional 
            Spaceport and made its inaugural flight on April 21, 2013.

            NASA awarded Orbital a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Space Act 
            Agreement (SAA) in 2008 to demonstrate delivery of cargo to the International Space 
            Station. For these COTS missions Orbital intends to use Antares to launch its Cygnus 
            spacecraft. In addition, Antares will compete for small-to-medium missions. Originally 
            designated the Taurus II, Orbital Sciences renamed the vehicle Antares, after the star 
            of the same name, on December 12, 2011.
            
            The first four Antares launch attempts were successful. During the fifth launch on 
            October 28, 2014, the rocket failed catastrophically, and the vehicle and payload were 
            destroyed. The failure was traced to a fault in the first stage engines. After 
            completion of a redesign program, the rocket had a successful return to flight on 
            October 17, 2016.
            
            The NASA COTS award was for US$171 million and Orbital Sciences expected to invest an 
            additional $150 million, split between $130 million for the booster and $20 million 
            for the spacecraft. A Commercial Resupply Service contract of $1.9 billion for 8 flights 
            was awarded in 2008. As of April 2012, development costs were estimated at $472 
            million.

            On June 10, 2008, it was announced that the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, formerly 
            part of the Wallops Flight Facility, in Virginia, would be the primary launch site for 
            the rocket. Launch pad 0A (LP-0A), previously used for the failed Conestoga rocket, 
            would be modified to handle Antares. Wallops allows launches which reach the 
            International Space Station's orbit as effectively as those from Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
            while being less crowded. The first Antares flight launched a Cygnus mass simulator.
            
            On December 10, 2009, Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) test-fired their Castor 30 motor 
            for use on the second stage of the Antares rocket. In March 2010, Orbital Sciences 
            and Aerojet completed test firings of the NK-33 engines. On February 22, 2013, a hot 
            fire test was successfully performed, the entire first stage being erected on the pad 
            and held down while the engines fired for 29 seconds.

            Ares I was the crew launch vehicle that was being developed by NASA as part of the 
            Constellation program. The name "Ares" refers to the Greek deity Ares, who is 
            identified with the Roman god Mars. Ares I was originally known as the "Crew 
            Launch Vehicle" (CLV).

            NASA planned to use Ares I to launch Orion, the spacecraft intended for NASA human 
            spaceflight missions after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Ares I was to 
            complement the larger, uncrewed Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for 
            Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, 
            reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the Constellation program, including 
            Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage 
            of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space

The Ares V (formerly known as the Cargo Launch Vehicle or CaLV) was the planned cargo launch component of the cancelled NASA Constellation program, which was to have replaced the Space Shuttle after its retirement in 2011. Ares V was also planned to carry supplies for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and the smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the Greek god of war.

The Ares V was to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for NASA's return to the Moon, which was planned for 2019. It would also have served as the principal launcher for missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, including the program's ultimate goal, a crewed mission to Mars. The uncrewed Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-rated Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4‚Äì6 person Orion spacecraft. Both rockets, deemed safer than the then-current Space Shuttle, would have employed technologies developed for the Apollo program, the Shuttle program, and the Delta IV EELV program. However, the Constellation program, including Ares V and Ares I was canceled in October 2010 by the NASA 
Authorization Act of 2010. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space Launch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit, while commercial space companies would provide low earth orbit access for both cargo and astronauts.

In the 1996 book The Case for Mars, author Robert Zubrin discussed a possible future heavy launch vehicle named Ares. In the book, the rocket would have consisted of the Space Shuttle external tank powered by four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) and a second stage powered by an RL-10 engine. One notable difference in the Zubrin et al. design is that the SSMEs were on a small side-mounted flyback craft. This design was meant to allow the Ares to fly using existing Space Shuttle infrastructure.

Ares V was to be the cargo launch component of the Constellation program. Unlike the Saturn V and Space Shuttle, where the crew and cargo were launched together on the same rocket, Project Constellation planned to use two separate launch vehicles, the Ares I and the Ares V, for crew and cargo respectively. This configuration would have allowed the two launch vehicles to be optimized for their respective missions. Constellation therefore combined the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous used by Apollo with the Earth Orbit Rendezvous mode proposed by Dr. Wernher von Braun (along with the "Direct Ascent" proposal) during the early planning stage of Apollo.

Development of the rocket and its Earth departure stage was led by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. NASA Ames Research Center was responsible for the Ares V integrated health management system supports in developing its payload shroud. Glenn Research Center led the development of the lunar lander ascent stage as well as Ares V power system, thrust vector control system and payload shroud. Langley Research Center had a lead role on Ares V aerodynamics.

In 2007, NASA announced that Alliant Techsystems will be the contractor for the SRBs of both Ares I and Ares V.

Although the Ares V was a medium to long term project, NASA planned to deploy its lift capability in a range of projects, along the lines of the former Apollo Applications Program.

One proposal was to build an 8- to 16-meter Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope to be placed in the Sun/Earth L2 point. It would be a significant increase in dimension and performance over the Hubble Space Telescope and the Ares V vehicle was expected to carry this to its destination in a single launch. Future Ares V missions could also have served as a cost-effective, mass transport of construction materials for future spacecraft and missions, delivering raw materials for example to a Moon dock.

In May 2010, NASA planned flight demonstrations of Ares V hardware along with Ares I hardware after the scheduled upcoming Ares I-X Prime test of the Ares I five-segment SRB first stage. Several flights were listed as "Heavy Lift" test flights for testing the first stage of the Ares V simultaneously with the Ares I upper stage attached on top of the Ares V first stage. 
This would save both time and money in avoiding the gap between testing Ares I and Ares V hardware with limited funding.

The Athena I, known as the Lockheed Launch Vehicle (LLV) at the time of its first flight and Lockheed Martin Launch Vehicle (LMLV) at the time of its second flight, is an American small expendable launch system which was used for four launches between 1995 and 2001. It is a member of the Athena family of rockets, along with the larger Athena II.

The Athena I is a three-stage rocket, consisting of solid first and second stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fuelled third stage. The first stage is a Castor 120, which is also used on some versions of the Taurus rocket. An Orbus 21D motor was used as the second stage on launches up to 2001. If the rocket returns to service as Athena Ic, the Castor 30 would be used instead, which was developed for the Antares rocket (originally called Taurus II). The third stage is an Orbital Adjustment Module, fuelled by hydrazine and propelled by four MR-107 engines, which is used for final insertion.

Prior to its retirement in 2001, Athena I launches were made from Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Launch Complex 46 at Spaceport Florida, and Pad 1 of the Kodiak Launch Complex. Future Athena Ic flights could use the pads at Kodiak or Canaveral, with Launch Pad 0B of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport also on offer. If a launch from Vandenberg is ordered, Space Launch Complex 8 would be used instead of SLC-6, which was rebuilt as a Delta IV launch complex following the Athena's initial retirement.

Four Athena I launches have been conducted, with one failure. Its maiden flight was conducted from SLC-6 at Vandenberg, and lifted off at 22:30 UTC on 15 August 1995. It was intended to place GemStar-1 into orbit, however the rocket was destroyed by the range safety officer after the failure of its thrust vectoring system resulted in a loss of control. The launch was the first from SLC-6, which had originally been built for the Titan III rocket for launches of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, and was later rebuilt for polar orbit Space Shuttle launches. Both MOL and polar Shuttle flights were cancelled before any launches were made from SLC-6. The next Athena I launch was on 23 August 1997, and successfully placed the Lewis satellite into orbit for NASA. This launch also took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg. The third Athena I launch was from LC-46 at Spaceport Florida, and took place on 27 January 1999. The payload, ROCSAT-1, was the first satellite to be operated by the Republic of China. The fourth launch, which was conducted on 30 September 2001, was the first orbital launch to be made from Kodiak Island. Known as the Kodiak Star mission, it successfully placed the Starshine 3, Picosat 9, PCSat and Sapphire satellites into orbit.

The Athena II is an American small expendable launch system which was used for three launches between 1998 and 1999, and which was scheduled to return to service in 2012 but has not been flown again as of January 2017. It is a member of the Athena family of rockets, along with the smaller Athena I. Future launches would use the Athena IIc configuration, which features a different third stage.

The Athena II is a four-stage rocket, consisting of solid first, second and third stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fuelled fourth stage. The first and second stages are Castor 120s, which are also used on some versions of the Taurus rocket. An Orbus 21D motor was used as the third stage on launches during the 1990s, however when it returns to service in 2012 the Castor 30, which is under development for the Taurus II, will be used instead. The fourth stage is an Orbital Adjustment Module, fuelled by hydrazine and propelled by four MR-107 engines, which is used for final insertion.

Prior to its retirement in 1999, Athena II launches were made from Launch Complex 46 at Spaceport Florida and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LC-46 will also be used for Athena IIc launches, with Launch Pad 0B of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and Pad 1 of the Kodiak Launch Complex also offered. If a launch from Vandenberg is ordered, Space Launch Complex 8 will be used instead of SLC-6, which was rebuilt as a Delta IV launch complex following the Athena's initial retirement.

During the 1990s, three Athena II launches were conducted, with one failure. Its maiden flight was conducted from LC-46 at Spaceport Florida, and lifted off at 02:28 GMT on 7 January 1997. The launch, which was the first to take place from Spaceport Florida, successfully placed the Lunar Prospector spacecraft into orbit for NASA. The next Athena II launch took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg on 27 April 1999, with the Ikonos satellite for Space Imaging. The launch ended in failure after the payload fairing failed to separate, and as a result the rocket had too much mass to achieve orbital velocity. The third launch also took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg, on 24 September 1999. The payload, Ikonos 1, was also for Space Imaging, and successfully reached orbit.

The Convair SM-65B Atlas, or Atlas B, also designated X-12 was a prototype of the Atlas missile. First flown on 19 July 1958, the Atlas B was the first version of the Atlas rocket to use the stage and a half design with an operational sustainer engine and jettisonable rocket booster section. Unlike later Atlas models, the Atlas B used explosive bolts to jettison the booster section.

Ten flights were made. Nine of these were sub-orbital test flights of the Atlas as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, with five successful missions and four failures. The seventh flight, launched on 18 December 1958, was used to place the SCORE satellite into low Earth orbit, the first orbital launch conducted by an Atlas rocket.

The B series test program took a considerable amount of delays and frustration, not in the least because the Atlas B was far more complicated than the prototype Atlas A, in fact the first launch would feature all hardware systems found on an operational Atlas, including the sustainer engine, separable booster section, guidance computer, Azusa tracking system, detachable nose cone, and more. The first flight article missile, 3B, was originally planned for launch in May 1958, but the date was set back by endless hardware difficulties, both with the missile itself and the newly opened LC-11. In addition, Atlas 3B could not be cleared for flight until a successful firing run of Missile 2B was performed at the Sycamore Canyon test stand, which was also experiencing nonstop technical issues. 
The launch of a third Soviet satellite in April also put further pressure on program planners. Finally, on July 19, Missile 3B was launched. Engine start proceeded normally and the launcher release system functioned well. The Atlas performed well until T+21 seconds when the programmer attempted to initiate the pitch and roll maneuver. At this point, the missile began swerving from side to side uncontrollably and finally broke up at the forward end of the LOX tank at T+43 seconds, the lower portion from the fuel tank downward remaining intact until impact in the ocean. Even before the flight had terminated, real time telemetry readouts clearly indicated that the fault lay in the yaw gyro motor, which was not running. To prevent a recurrence of this, Convair developed the Spin Motor Rotation Detection system, 
a collection of sensors designed to ensure proper gyroscope operation and which would prevent the launch if the motors were not running at the proper speed. It was not fully phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961 however. Atlas 3B was considered "partially successful" because all other systems had functioned properly. The only other abnormality was an unusually high usage of helium pressure gas, possibly due to a leak. If the flight had not terminated prematurely, the helium supply might have become depleted. Tank pressures however remained within normal levels until missile destruction. A minor thrust section fire was evident from T+9 seconds, caused by placement of the lube oil vent line near the booster turbine exhaust, however this was believed to have no connection to the subsequent loss of the missile. 
One telemetry channel failed during the prelaunch countdown, as a consequence 13 telemetry measurements were inactive during the flight.

On Missile 4B, the location of the lube oil vent lines was moved, and improved heat insulation added to the firewall and engine boots. It was successfully launched on August 2 from LC-13 on a 2500-mile flight. All systems functioned well and booster section separation, which was tested for the first time, occurred on schedule. Two problems occurred on 4B. The first involved high vibration levels following BECO; this was corrected by a few modifications to the autopilot, as well as moving the rate gyros forward slightly to increase their responsiveness to missile bending. The other was a repeat of the high helium usage on 3B, due to a suspected fault in the LOX tank pressure regulator. At T+155 seconds, the LOX tank pressure surged to the point where it went out of instrumentation range. 
Total helium usage for booster phase was 14 pounds higher than normal, and 11 pounds higher than normal during sustainer phase.

Missile 5B was launched from LC-11 on August 29 and reached an apogee of 550 miles. On 5B, pneumatic system problems occurred once again when LOX tank pressure increased abruptly, and the pneumatic system failed to cut off the flow of helium to the tank, which continued past SECO. Helium usage for the booster phase of flight was 17 pounds above normal and 2.7 pounds above normal for booster phase. During vernier solo phase, insufficient hydraulic pressure to the verniers was maintained, resulting in an unstable flight path, however the RV impacted close to the target point. In addition, the guidance system rate beacon experienced difficulties early in the flight, however discreet steering commands were issued properly. One telemetry channel failed at T+164 seconds.

Missile 8B on September 14 continued the streak of pneumatic system difficulties when the LOX tank pressure regulator went full open for five seconds starting at T+210 seconds, resulting in a surge in tank pressure. The problem in this case was suspected to be caused by above-normal helium bottle temperatures. In addition, vernier hydraulic pressure failed again during vernier solo phase.

Missile 6B broke the streak of successful flights on September 18 when it exploded 82 seconds after liftoff. The cause of the failure was traced to a seized turbopump, which resulted in abrupt termination of B-1 engine thrust at T+80 seconds. LOX regulator pressure fell off, resulting in gas generator flameout and complete shutdown of both booster engines, followed by missile pitch-up and structural breakup. It was suspected that flying debris from the turbopump had ruptured the LOX regulator sense line. At liftoff, one of the launcher hold-down arms had also not retracted properly, which resulted in holes being torn in the B-1 thrust structure, however this was quickly ruled out as a cause of the failure.

The turbopump failure was a persistent problem that had plagued Thor, Jupiter, and Atlas launches, all of which used a variant of the same Rocketdyne engine and which had an extremely marginal turbopump design that resulted in the lubricant oil foaming at high altitude and causing the bearings in the pump to come loose, resulting in instant pump shutdown. The Army Ballistic Missile Division had replaced all of the turbopumps in their stock of Jupiter missiles and did not experience any turbopump failures after December 1957, but the Air Force resisted doing the same with Thor and Atlas missiles so as to not delay the test program. The result was that several pump-related failures occurred in the Thor and Atlas programs during 1958 and only after Atlas 6B did they finally give in and agree to replace the pumps.

Missile 9B, the first Atlas with upgraded turbopumps, was launched on November 18. Roll control was extremely poor for the first 44 seconds of launch, resulting in excessive movements of the booster engines and verniers to maintain missile stability. Excessive fuel consumption led to premature sustainer shutdown and so the missile did not achieve its planned range of 3150 miles, instead managing only 2300 miles. BECO occurred at T+131 seconds and SECO at T+227 seconds, while nose cone separation was not accomplished. The malfunction was due to the turbopumps, which were also C-series models, not being properly matched to the engines in the Atlas. Due to the need to test them out, there had not been any time to perform this step. The roll control problem resulted in yet more autopilot modifications.

On November 29, Missile 12B was successfully launched from LC-14 and made a 6325-mile lob, the first full-range flight of an Atlas missile. This step was achieved a full six months earlier than originally anticipated by program plans.

On the evening of December 18, Missile 10B performed the first use of an Atlas for a space launch when it orbited SCORE, a prototype communications satellite. This Atlas included several modifications for the flight, including 5-second vernier start tanks. The missile was also stripped down to save weight‚Äîthe Azusa tracking system, telemetry packages, and all other hardware not absolutely essential to the flight were removed. In addition, it was equipped with MA-1 engines that had been tested and found to have above-average performance. The launch was conducted with stringent secrecy, in part because the Air Force were concerned about another embarrassing public launch failure like Vanguard TV-3 the year before. In the event that SCORE failed, they could simply claim that it was an ICBM test, 
and most of the launch crew also did not know 10B's true mission, as the missile was shipped to CCAS carrying a standard blunt Atlas RV and only the night before the launch was the satellite mounted on top of it. Orbital launches required a considerably different flight path than missiles, and during launch, the Range Safety Officer, who assumed it was a routine Atlas missile test, almost pressed the destruct button on noticing that the trajectory was "off", but he was quickly talked out of it. SCORE transmitted a tape-recorded Christmas greeting from President Eisenhower and operated for 13 days until the batteries ran down. The satellite, which remained attached to the spent Atlas, decayed from orbit on January 21, 1959. With a combined weight of 8660 pounds (3928 kg), 
it held the record for largest artificial object in space for a number of years. The lack of a telemetry system meant that limited data on the missile's performance was available, however all systems appeared to operate correctly throughout powered flight other than the autopilot. The roll program was executed properly, however the missile pitched up approximately 11¬∞ from the planned flight trajectory. A backup command from the guidance system at T+138 seconds corrected it, and the malfunction was believed to be due to a slight misalignment of the gyro canister.

On January 16, 1959, Missile 13B, which was the backup booster for SCORE and carried the same modified hardware, was launched from LC-14 but lost thrust slightly under a minute into launch and fell into the Atlantic Ocean. The exact cause of the failure could not be determined because just like 10B, the missile was not carrying a telemetry package due to the intended mission of flying an Atlas to its maximum range, which required stripping the missile down to as light a weight as possible. Starting at T+100 seconds, the engines began gimbaling in all three axes, resulting in complete loss of control and missile tumbling. Propulsion system performance started decaying at T+109 seconds and the engines completely shut down at T+121 seconds. 
The missile remained structurally intact until impact with the ocean. The failure was believed to have been caused by exhaust gases being sucked into the thrust section and burning through wiring.

The Atlas B test program concluded with the successful flight of Missile 11B on February 4, which reached an apogee of 610 miles. Missile performance exhibited two small abnormalities--high vibration in the booster engine hydraulic pump for the first 17 seconds of flight and slightly high booster engine thrust, the latter of which was attributed to a malfunction of the ground support equipment on LC-11.

All Atlas B launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11, 13 and 14.

Atlas II was a member of the Atlas family of launch vehicles, which evolved from the successful Atlas missile program of the 1950s. It was designed to launch payloads into low earth orbit, geosynchronous transfer orbit or geosynchronous orbit. Sixty-three launches of the Atlas II, IIA and IIAS models were carried out between 1991 and 2004; all sixty-three launches were successes, making the Atlas II the most reliable launch system in history. The Atlas line was continued by the Atlas III, used between 2000 and 2005, and the Atlas V which is still in use.

Atlas II provided higher performance than the earlier Atlas I by using engines with greater thrust and longer fuel tanks for both stages. LR-89 and LR-105 were replaced by the RS-56, derived from the RS-27. The total thrust capability of the Atlas II of 490,000 pounds force (2,200 kN) enabled the booster to lift payloads of 6,100 pounds (2,767 kg) into geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) of 22,000 miles (35,000 km) or more. Atlas II was the last Atlas to use a three engine, "stage-and-a-half" design: two of its three engines were jettisoned during ascent, but its fuel tanks and other structural elements were retained. The two booster engines, RS-56-OBAs, were integrated into a single unit called the MA-5A and shared a common gas generator. They burned for 164 seconds before being jettisoned. The central sustainer engine, an RS-56-OSA, would burn for an additional 125 seconds. The Vernier engines on the first stage of the Atlas I were replaced by a hydrazine fueled roll control system.

This series used an improved Centaur upper stage, the world's first cryogenic propellant stage, to increase its payload capability. Atlas II also had lower-cost electronics, an improved flight computer and longer propellant tanks than its predecessor, Atlas I.

-Versions-
Atlas II
The original Atlas II was based on the Atlas I and its predecessors. This version flew between 1991 and 1998.

Atlas IIA
Atlas IIA was a derivative designed to service the commercial launch market. The main improvement was the switch from the RL10A-3-3A to RL10A-4 engine on the Centaur upper stage. The IIA version flew between 1992 and 2002.

Atlas IIAS
Atlas IIAS was largely identical to IIA, but added four Castor 4A solid rocket boosters to increase performance. These boosters were ignited in pairs, with one pair igniting on the ground, and the second igniting in the air shortly after the first pair separated. The half-stage booster section would then drop off as usual. IIAS was used between 1993 and 2004, concurrently with IIA.

In May 1988, the Air Force chose General Dynamics (now Lockheed-Martin) to develop the Atlas II vehicle, primarily to launch Defense Satellite Communications System payloads and for commercial users as a result of Atlas I launch failures in the late 1980s. Led by lead engineer Samuel Wagner, the Atlas II was crucial to the continued development of the United States' space program.

Atlas IIs were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., by the 45th Space Wing. The final West Coast Atlas II launch was accomplished December 2003 by the 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, California.

The Atlas III (known as the Atlas II-AR (R for Russian) early in development) was an American orbital launch vehicle, used between 2000 and 2005.It was the first member of the Atlas family since the Atlas A to feature a "normal" staging method, compared to the previous Atlas family members, which were equipped with two jettisonable outboard engines on the first (booster) stage (with a single center engine serving as the sustainer).

The Atlas III consisted of two stages. The first stage was new, but the upper stage was the Centaur, which is still in use today on the Atlas V EELV. The first stage engines were Russian RD-180s, which are also used by the Atlas V. The Atlas III was produced in two versions. The baseline was the Atlas IIIA, but the Atlas IIIB, featuring a twin-engine version of the Centaur upper stage, was also produced.

The GX rocket, formerly under development by Galaxy Express Corporation, was originally intended to use the boost stage of the Atlas III, provided by Lockheed-Martin, and a newly designed upper stage. It would have launched from the Tanegashima Space Center, south of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan. In December 2009 the Japanese government decided to cancel the GX project.

The Minotaur I, or just Minotaur is an American expendable launch system derived from the Minuteman II missile. It is used to launch small satellites for the US Government, and is a member of the Minotaur family of rockets produced by Orbital Sciences Corporation.

The Minotaur I is the follow-on to the Orbital Sciences' Taurus (later re-named the "Minotaur-C") launch vehicle, combining the original Taurus's booster stage with a second stage from a Minuteman missile.

Minotaur I rockets consist of the M55A1 first stage and SR19 second stage of a decommissioned Minuteman missile. The Orion 50XL and Orion 38, from the Pegasus rocket, are used as third and fourth stages. A HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) upper stage can also be flown if greater precision is needed, or the rocket needs to be able to manoeuvre to deploy multiple payloads. It can place up to 580 kilograms (1,280 lb) of payload into a 185-kilometer (115 mi) low Earth orbit at 28.5 degrees of inclination.

Initially Minotaur I launches are conducted from Space Launch Complex 8 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. Starting with the launch of TacSat-2 in December 2006, launches have also been conducted from Pad 0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island.

Minotaur IV, also known as Peacekeeper SLV and OSP-2 PK is an active expendable launch system derived from the LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBM. It is operated by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, and made its maiden flight on 22 April 2010, carrying the HTV-2a Hypersonic Test Vehicle. The first orbital launch occurred on 26 September 2010 with the SBSS satellite for the United States Air Force.

The Minotaur IV vehicle consists of four stages and is capable of placing 1,735 kilograms (3,825 lb) of payload into a Low Earth orbit (LEO). It uses the first three stages of the Peacekeeper missile, combined with a new upper stage. On the baseline version, the fourth stage is an Orion 38. However a higher performance variant, designated Minotaur IV+, uses a Star-48V instead. A three-stage configuration (no Orion 38), designated the Minotaur IV Lite, is available for suborbital trajectories. The Minotaur IV has also been flown with multiple upper stages. A five-stage derivative, the Minotaur V, made its maiden flight on 7 September 2013.

Minotaur IV launches are conducted from SLC-8 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, LP-0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, SLC-46 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Pacific Spaceport Complex ‚Äì Alaska Pad 1 of the Pacific Spaceport Complex ‚Äì Alaska (PSCA).

The third Minotaur IV launch, which was also known as STP-S26, deployed eight payloads. It was the 26th small launch vehicle mission in STP's 40-year history of flying DoD space experiments,[13] STP-S26 was intended to extend previous standard interface development efforts, implementing a number of capabilities aimed at enabling responsive access to space for small experimental satellites and payloads. STP-S26 launched at 01:25 UTC on 20 November 2010 from the Kodiak Launch Complex. The launch facility contractor was Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC). The payloads were released in a 650 kilometres (400 mi) orbit, before the HAPS upper stage was demonstrated by deploying two ballast payloads into a 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) orbit.

The primary objective of the STP-S26 launch was to deploy STPSAT-2 (USA-217), whilst demonstrating the ability of the Minotaur IV to carry additional payloads, by deploying FASTSAT, FASTRAC, RAX, O/OREOS and FalconSat-5. A Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System upper stage was flown aboard the Minotaur to demonstrate its ability to deploy payloads to multiple orbits, however only mass simulators were deployed after the HAPS burn.

The launch marked the first flight of a STP-SIV (Standard Interface Vehicle) satellite, the first use of the Multi Mission Satellite Operations Center Ground System Architecture (MMSOC GSA), the first flight of the Minotaur IV's Multi-payload Adapter (MPA), the first use of a HAPS to obtain multiple orbits on a Minotaur IV flight, the first Minotaur launch from Kodiak Launch Complex (KLC), and the first deployment of CubeSats from a Minotaur IV via Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployers (P-Pods).

The Minotaur V is an American expendable launch system derived from the Minotaur IV, itself a derivative of the LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBM. It was developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, (now absorbed into Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems) and made its maiden flight on 7 September 2013 carrying the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft for NASA.

The Minotaur V is a five-stage vehicle, and is designed to place up to 630 kilograms (1,390 lb) of payload into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, or 342 kilograms (754 lb) on a trans-lunar trajectory. It consists of a Minotaur IV+, with a Star-37 as a fifth stage. Two variants are available, one with a spin-stabilized Star-37FM upper stage, and the other with a Star-37FMV capable of three-axis stabilization. The Star-37FMV upper stage is heavier, reducing payload capacity, but is more maneuverable.

Minotaur-C (Minotaur Commercial), formerly known as Taurus or Taurus XL, is a four stage solid fueled launch vehicle built in the United States by Orbital Sciences (now Northrop Grumman) and launched from SLC-576E at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. It is based on the air-launched Pegasus rocket from the same manufacturer, utilizing a "zeroth stage" in place of an airplane. The Minotaur-C is able to carry a maximum payload of around 1458 kg into a low Earth orbit (LEO).

First launched in 1994, it has successfully completed seven out of a total of ten military and commercial missions. Three of four launches between 2001 and 2011 ended in failure, including the 24 February 2009 launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission and the 4 March 2011 launch of the Glory mission, which resulted in losses totalling US$700 million for NASA (excluding the cost of the rockets themselves). The Taurus launch vehicle was subsequently rebranded in 2014 as Minotaur-C, which incorporates new avionics based on those used by the Minotaur family of rockets. After a six years pause, the rocket successfully returned to flight in 2017 as Minotaur-C.

OmegA was a medium to heavy-lift launch vehicle concept that spent several years in development by Northrop Grumman during 2016‚Äì2020, with that development substantially funded by the US government. OmegA was intended for launching US national security satellites, as part of the US Department of the Air Force NSSL replacement program. In August 2020, the design was not selected by the Air Force in the competitive process, and NGIS has decided not to continue the development as a commercial competitive offering with further development funded by NGIS.

The OmegA design consisted of new composite solid rocket stages with a cryogenic upper stage provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne, replacing earlier plans to use an upper stage engine provided by Blue Origin. The OmegA design was similar to the defunct Ares I and Liberty projects, both of which consisted of a five segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a cryogenic second stage. It was intended to be launched from Kennedy Space Center LC-39B or Vandenberg Air Force Base SLC-6. OmegA was proposed as a vehicle to launch national security satellites for the United States Space Force and other government agencies, including to geostationary transfer orbit. The launch vehicle could theoretically launch commercial payloads as well, but was not designed at a price point to make private competitive launches likely. NGIS claimed in 2016 that crewed spacecraft could also be launched, just as the predecessor Ares I and Liberty rockets, which were designed to be able to also launch the Orion space capsule.

As of 2016, actual development was to get underway only once the Air Force reached a funding decision. In October 2018, the Air Force announced that Northrop Grumman was awarded $792 million for initial development of the OmegA launch vehicle.

In August 2020, the Department of the Air Force announced the results of the approximately US$3.5 billion National Security Space Launch Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement for launches in the 2022‚Äì2027 timeframe and OmegA was not selected. The USAF announced that it would wind down any remaining OmegA development contracts from phase 1, and may not pay out the entire maximum amount of the earlier 2019 contract to NGIS. NGIS decided not to bring the OmegA launch vehicle to market on their own later in August, and will wind down work on the rocket.

The company that was to propose the OmegA launch vehicle in 2016 (Orbital ATK, which was subsequently acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2018), through its predecessor company Alliant Techsystems (ATK), had developed the solid rocket boosters for the Space Shuttle in the 1970s‚Äì80s, and military intercontinental missiles prior to that. With the 2004 announcement of the retirement of the Space Shuttle, the company was active in trying to find government purchasers of its, now, 30+ year old solid-propellant rocket technology to continue using the technology for orbital launch vehicles. Since then, they have approached both the US government's civil space branch, NASA, and also the miltary branch, US DoD, with proposals to develop continued government-funded opportunities to design, build and support the orbital space application of solid rocket technology. They were successful, as NASA selected ATK's technology for the Ares I crewed launch vehicle in 2005, with ATK supplying the a five-segment solid rocket booster as the first stage while also being the primary contractor for the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which was to have a more standard liquid-propellant powered upper stage. Following the early cancellation of the Ares I rocket in 2010, ATK proposed the Liberty (rocket) to NASA in 2011, which was subsequently not selected for full development funding in 2012. ATK then pursued options with the US DoD.

In January 2016, Orbital ATK was one of two companies awarded funds by the United States Air Force to develop technologies to eliminate dependency on the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine for US national security payloads.[7] The award was worth an initial $46.9 million, with an option for up to $180.2 million total. This was to be matched by $31.1 million initially, and up to $124.8 million in company funds if all options of the contract are exercised. The contract would fund the development of three technologies in support of the OmegA rocket, then called Next Generation Launcher: the GEM-63XL strap-on booster, a Common Booster Core and an extendable nozzle for the BE-3U upper stage engine. A previous effort, funded by NASA, demonstrated the technology for a composite motor case to replace the metal motor cases used for Space Shuttle SRBs.

In May 2016, Orbital ATK revealed their plans for the Next Generation Launcher, including the configuration and the intended business case. The Next Generation Launcher intends to make use of existing launch infrastructure at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), including the Vehicle Assembly Building used by the Space Shuttle, with the possibility of polar orbit launches occurring from Vandenberg Air Force Base. NASA began looking for commercial users to operate unused space within the Vehicle Assembly Building in June 2015, and by April 2016, it was announced that Orbital ATK was in negotiations to lease High Bay 2. Orbital ATK claimed that a minimum of 5‚Äì6 launches per year would be required to make the rocket profitable. Full development and introduction will be dependent on both demand and funding from the US Air Force. A final "go/no-go decision" to proceed with full development and introduction of the Next Generation Launcher took place in early 2018.

In April 2017, Orbital ATK revealed that OmegA would be launched from pad 39B at KSC, sharing launch facilities and mobile transporter with the NASA Space Launch System (SLS). The rocket would compete for USAF national security launches and NASA missions. There would be multiple configurations of the launch system, with multiple stages.

In April 2018, Orbital ATK announced that Next Generation Launcher would be named OmegA. Additionally, they revealed the selection of the RL-10C engine over Blue Origin's BE-3U competitor. The intermediate configuration, with a Castor 600 first stage, increased payload to GTO from 8,500 kilograms (18,700 lb) to 10,100 kilograms (22,300 lb). The Castor 1200-powered Heavy configuration increased GEO payload from 7,000 kilograms (15,000 lb) to 7,800 kilograms (17,200 lb) and has a TLI capability of up to 12,300 kg (27,000 lb).

Orbital ATK was purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2018, and OmegA became a Northrop Grumman product.

In October 2018, OmegA was awarded a Launch Services Agreement worth $791,601,015 to design, build and launch the first OmegA rockets.

In late May 2019, while conducting a static fire test of the first stage SRB, an anomaly occurred resulting in the destruction of the SRB nozzle (but not the stage itself). A thorough investigation revealed that the differential pressure between the nozzle's internal pressure and surface pressure following the static fire test was greater than expected; when thrust levels dropped below a critical point upon completion of the static fire, the outside air crushed the nozzle "in an instant, just like a soda can."

In 2019, Northrop Grumman bid the OmegA launch vehicle to the US Air Force for the multi-year block buy launch contract that would cover all US national security launches in 2022‚Äì2026.

In August 2020, the US Department of the Air Force announced the results of the approximately US$3.5 billion National Security Space Launch Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement, selecting only SpaceX and ULA to supply launches to the US Department of Defense in the 2022‚Äì2027 timeframe. NGIS OmegA was not selected. The contract type for the phase 2 contracts is new for US government launches as it will be a "firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery" type of launch contract and these contract awards are a part of "the transition of the national security launch program to take advantage of commercial innovation and private investments in launch vehicles." NGIS indicated they were "disappointed by the decision."The fate of the OmegA launch vehicle is unclear, as NGIS depended on the funding from the US military to develop the vehicle design to this point.

The USAF announced on 7 August that they would wind down any remaining OmegA development contracts from phase 1, and may not pay out the entire maximum amount of the earlier 2019 contract to NGIS. The Air Force stated that they would work with NGIS "to determine the right point to tie off their work under the LSA agreements. ... The goal is not to carry them indefinitely, the point of an LSA was to create a more competitive environment."

As of 20 August 2020, NGIS had not publically commented on future plans for the OmegA design; but on 18 August they did inform employees involved with OmegA that they would not be continuing the project.

The OmegA launch vehicle concept is a three-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle originally proposed by Orbital ATK (subsequently Northrop Grumman after the 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK) that principally uses three different solid-propellant rockets to get to orbit, along with a hydrolox upper stage.

The OmegA design was 59.84 m (196.3 ft) with a 3.71 m (12.2 ft)-diameter first and second stages and a 5.25 m (17.2 ft)-diameter upper stage.

There were intended to be two version of the main rocket stack, plus variable 2 to 6 SRBs attached to the first stage to assist with the entire variety of NSSL reference orbits.

The design payload for the primary DoD missions that it was being aimed at was 4,900 kg (10,800 lb) to 10,100 kg (22,300 lb) to GTO with the "Intermediate" version and 5,250 kg (11,570 lb) to 7,800 kg (17,200 lb) to GEO with the "Heavy" version.

It was intended to be launched from either Kennedy LC-39B or [Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg]] SLC-6, the two locations used for all US DoD launches.

The full vehicle was never built, nor launched, as NGIS was not selected by the Department of the Air Force to receive more funding to build and test the vehicle.

The component details for the OmegA design are:[citation needed]

SRBs: 2 to 6 GEM-63XLT of 1.6 m (63 in) diameter, attached to the first stage, using HTPB solid propellant, with a specific impulse of 279.3 s (2.739 km/s)
First stage: Castor Solid Rocket Booster using HTPB propellant
Castor600 (Intermediate version)
Castor 1200 (Heavy version)
Second stage: Castor 300 1-segment solid rocket booster, HTPB
Third stage: 2 √ó RL-10C-5-1 LH2/LOX rocket engines with 101.8 kN (22,890 lbf) thrust and a vacuum-rated Isp of ‚âà450 seconds
Multiple configurations
The rocket was to have had two basic configurations, an intermediate and a heavy launch. Both configurations would have had a minimum of two thrust vectoring GEM-63XLTs for roll control. The intermediate version was to have had a two segment solid rocket booster (SRB) first stage, a single segment SRB second stage, and a liquid hydrogen fueled third stage, while the heavy configuration would have a 4-segment SRB first stage, and the same upper stages. Additional versions could conceiveably have added additional SRBs as side boosters with the SRBs sharing avionics suites with other Orbital ATK rockets to reduce costs.

Pegasus is an air-launched rocket developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation and now built and launched by Northrop Grumman. Capable of carrying small payloads of up to 443 kilograms (977 lb) into low Earth orbit, Pegasus first flew in 1990 and remains active as of 2019. The vehicle consists of three solid propellant stages and an optional monopropellant fourth stage. Pegasus is released from its carrier aircraft at approximately 40,000 ft (12,000 m), and its first stage has a wing and a tail to provide lift and attitude control while in the atmosphere. Notably, the first stage does not have a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system.  Pegasus is the world's first privately developed space launch vehicle.

Pegasus was designed by a team led by Antonio Elias. The Pegasus's three Orion solid motors were developed by Hercules Aerospace (later Alliant Techsystems) specifically for the Pegasus launcher but using advanced carbon fiber, propellant formulation and case insulation technologies originally developed for the terminated USAF Small ICBM program. The wing and fins' structures were designed by Burt Rutan and his company, Scaled Composites, which manufactured them for Orbital.

Mass: 18,500 kg (Pegasus), 23,130 kg (Pegasus XL)
Length: 16.9 m (Pegasus), 17.6 m (Pegasus XL)
Diameter: 1.27 m
Wing span: 6.7 m
Payload: 443 kg (1.18 m diameter, 2.13 m length)
Started in the spring of 1987, the development project was funded by Orbital Sciences Corporation and Hercules Aerospace, and did not receive any government funding. NASA did provide the use of the B-52 carrier aircraft on a cost-reimbursable basis during the development (captive carry tests) and the first few flights. Two Orbital internal projects, the Orbcomm communications constellation and the OrbView observation satellites, served as anchor customers to help justify the private funding. 

DARPA purchased the first flight and options for five more, but only exercised the first of the five options. The DARPA contract was subsequently transferred to the U.S. Air Force which exercised the remaining four options. In 1993 NASA issued a Request for Proposals for a Small Expendable Launch Vehicles Services (SELVS) requiring a performance slightly higher than the original Pegasus, resulting in Orbital and Hercules developing the XL version to satisfy the NASA SELVS requirement.

There were no Pegasus test launches prior to the first operational launch on April 5, 1990 with NASA test pilot and former astronaut Gordon Fullerton in command of the carrier aircraft. Initially, a NASA-owned B-52 Stratofortress NB-008 served as the carrier aircraft. By 1994, Orbital had transitioned to their "Stargazer" L-1011, a converted airliner which was formerly owned by Air Canada. The name "Stargazer" is an homage to the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation: the character Jean-Luc Picard was captain of a ship named Stargazer prior to the events of the series, and his first officer William Riker once served aboard a ship named Pegasus.

During its 44-launch history, the Pegasus program had three mission failures (STEP-1, STEP-2 and HETI/SAC-B), and two partial failures, (USAF Microsat and STEP-2) followed by 30 consecutive successful flights for a total program success rate of 89%.. The first partial failure on July 17, 1991 caused the 7 USAF microsatellites to be delivered to a lower than planned orbit, significantly reducing the mission lifetime. The last mission failure on November 4, 1996 resulted in the loss of gamma-burst identifying satellite HETE (High Energy Transient Explorer) in 1996.


Preparations for launch of Pegasus XL carrying the NASA Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft.

The Pegasus XL with fairing removed exposing payload bay and the IBEX satellite
The Pegasus XL, introduced in 1994[citation needed] has lengthened stages to increase payload performance. In the Pegasus XL, the first and second stages are lengthened into the Orion 50SXL and Orion 50XL, respectively. Higher stages are unchanged; flight operations are similar. The wing is strengthened slightly to handle the higher weight. The standard Pegasus has been discontinued; the Pegasus XL is still active as of 2019. Pegasus has flown 44 missions in both configurations, launching 91 satellites as of October 12, 2019.

Dual payloads can be launched, with a canister that encloses the lower spacecraft and mounts the upper spacecraft. The upper spacecraft deploys, the canister opens, then the lower spacecraft separates from the third-stage adapter. Since the fairing is unchanged for cost and aerodynamic reasons, each of the two payloads must be relatively compact. Other multiple-satellite launches involve "self-stacking" configurations, such as the ORBCOMM spacecraft.

For their work in developing the rocket, the Pegasus team led by Antonio Elias was awarded the 1991 National Medal of Technology by U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

The initial launch price offered was US$6 million, without options or a HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) maneuvering stage. With the enlargement to Pegasus XL and the associated improvements to the vehicle, baseline prices increased. In addition, customers usually purchase additional services, such as extra testing, design and analysis, and launch-site support.

As of 2015, the most recent Pegasus XL to be purchased‚Äîa planned June 2017 launch of NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) mission‚Äîhad a total cost of $56.3 million, which NASA notes includes "firm-fixed launch service costs, spacecraft processing, payload integration, tracking, data and telemetry and other launch support requirements." A series of technical problems delayed this launch, which finally took place on 11 October 2019.

In July 2019, it was announced that Northrop had lost the launch contract of the IXPE satellite to SpaceX. IXPE had been planned to be launched by a Pegasus XL rocket, and had been designed so as to fit within the Pegasus XL rocket constraints. With the IXPE launch removed from the Pegasus XL rocket, there are currently (as of 12 October 2019, after the launch of ICON) no space launch missions announced for the Pegasus XL rocket. The future (under construction as of 2019) NASA Explorer program mission PUNCH was planned to be launched by Pegasus XL; but then NASA decided to merge the launches of PUNCH and another Explorer mission, TRACERS (also under construction as of 2019). These two space missions, consisting of 6 satellites in total, are to be launched by one rocket. It is expected that a larger launcher will be chosen for this dual mission launch. 

Northrop has 2 Pegasus XL's remaining in its inventory (as of 12 October 2019). It is looking for customers for those rockets. Northrop does not plan on retiring the Pegasus XL rocket as of October 2019.

For many small satellites it is desirable to be the primary payload and be placed into the orbit desired, rather than be a secondary payload placed in a compromise orbit. For example, Pegasus launched from equatorial launch sites can put spacecraft in orbits avoiding the South Atlantic Anomaly (a high radiation region over the South Atlantic Ocean) which is desirable for many scientific spacecraft. For some payloads, this may justify the higher cost of Pegasus relative to satellites launched as secondary cargoes on larger launchers.

In a Pegasus launch, the carrier aircraft takes off from a runway with support and checkout facilities. Such locations have included Kennedy Space Center / Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida; Vandenberg Air Force Base and Dryden Flight Research Center, California; Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia; Kwajalein Range in the Pacific Ocean, and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Orbital offers launches from Alcantara, Brazil, but no known customers have performed any.

Upon reaching a predetermined staging time, location, and velocity vector the aircraft releases the Pegasus. After five seconds of free-fall, the first stage ignites and the vehicle pitches up. The 45-degree delta wing (of carbon composite construction and double-wedge airfoil) aids pitch-up and provides some lift. The tail fins provide steering for first-stage flight, as the Orion 50S motor does not have a thrust-vectoring nozzle.

Approximately 1 minute and 17 seconds later, the Orion 50S motor burns out. The vehicle is at over 200,000 feet (61 km) in altitude and hypersonic speed. The first stage falls away, taking the wing and tail surfaces, and the second stage ignites. The Orion 50 burns for approximately 1 minute and 18 seconds. Attitude control is by thrust vectoring the Orion 50 motor around two axes, pitch and yaw; roll control is provided by nitrogen thrusters on the third stage.

Midway through second-stage flight, the launcher has reached a near-vacuum altitude. The fairing splits and falls away, uncovering the payload and third stage. Upon burnout of the second-stage motor, the stack coasts until reaching a suitable point in its trajectory, depending on mission. Then the Orion 50 is discarded, and the third stage's Orion 38 motor ignites. It too has a thrust-vectoring nozzle, assisted by the nitrogen thrusters for roll. After approximately 64 seconds, the third stage burns out.

A fourth stage is sometimes added for a higher altitude, finer altitude accuracy, or more complex maneuvers. The HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) is powered by three restartable, monopropellant hydrazine thrusters. As with dual launches, the HAPS cuts into the fixed volume available for payload. In at least one instance, the spacecraft was built around the HAPS.

Guidance is via a 32-bit computer and an IMU. A GPS receiver gives additional information. Due to the air launch and wing lift, the first-stage flight algorithm is custom-designed. The second- and third-stage trajectories are ballistic, and their guidance is derived from a Space Shuttle algorithm.

Pegasus components have also been the basis of other OSC launchers. The ground-launched Taurus rocket places the Pegasus stages and a larger fairing atop a Castor 120 first stage, derived from the first stage of the MX Peacekeeper missile. Initial launches used refurbished MX first stages.

The Minotaur I, also ground-launched, is a combination of stages from Taurus launchers and Minuteman missiles, hence the name. The first two stages are from a Minuteman II; the upper stages are Orion 50XL and 38. Due to the use of surplus military rocket motors, it is only used for US Government and government-sponsored payloads.

A third vehicle is dubbed Minotaur IV despite containing no Minuteman stages. It consists of a refurbished MX with an Orion 38 added as a fourth stage.

The NASA X-43A hypersonic test vehicles were boosted by Pegasus first stages. The upper stages were replaced by exposed models of a scramjet-powered vehicle. The Orion stages boosted the X-43 to its ignition speed and altitude, and were discarded. After firing the scramjet and gathering flight data, the test vehicles also fell into the Pacific.

The most numerous derivative of Pegasus is the booster for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GBMD) interceptor, basically a vertical (silo) launched Pegasus minus wing and fins, and with the first stage modified by addition of a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system.

The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development. The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, Interplanetary probes, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station. The Space Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.

Space Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines, a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and the expendable external tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Space Shuttle was launched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter's three main engines, which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion, which used the orbiter's two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter was protected during reentry by its thermal protection system tiles, and it glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, Florida, or to Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base, California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, a specially modified Boeing 747.

The first orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976, used in Approach and Landing Tests and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of Atlantis's final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the International Space Station from the last Shuttle flight until the first Commercial Crew Development launch on May 30, 2020.

During the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and air-to-ground weapons employment. In the late 1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable X-20 Dyna-Soar. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of Project Gemini led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the aerospaceplane, a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962‚Äì1963.

Beginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing lifting bodies to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the M2-F1, M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A, and the X-24B. The program tested aerodynamic characteristics that would later be incorporated in design of the Space Shuttle, including unpowered landing from a high altitude and speed.

In September 1966, NASA and the Air Force released a joint study concluding that a new vehicle was required to satisfy their respective future demands, and that a partially reusable system would be the most cost-effective solution. The head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight, George Mueller, announced the plan for a reusable shuttle on August 10, 1968. NASA issued a request for proposal (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.

In December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support short-duration crewed missions and space station, as well as the capabilities to launch, service, and retrieve satellites. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President Spiro Agnew, issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear upper stage for deep space travel.

After the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. Max Faget, a NASA engineer who had worked to design the Mercury capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster. The Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory argued that a straight-wing design would not be able to withstand the high thermal and aerodynamic stresses during reentry, and would not provide the required cross-range capability. Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.

After they established the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force determined the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting 29,000 kg (65,000 lb) to an eastward LEO or 18,000 kg (40,000 lb) into a polar orbit. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a 4.6 by 18 m (15 by 60 ft) payload bay. NASA evaluated the F-1 and J-2 engines from the Saturn rockets, and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to Rocketdyne to begin development on the RS-25 engine.

NASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use solid-propellant boosters because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President Richard Nixon approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That August, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to Morton Thiokol, and the external tank contract to Martin Marietta.

On June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named Enterprise. Enterprise was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and Enterprise was moved to the Edwards Air Force Base to begin testing.[6]:173[12] Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL) to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile. Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.

The beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while Pratt & Whitney challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttleable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.

NASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's thermal protection system. Previous NASA spacecraft had used ablative heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight aluminum, and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on Columbia on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, Columbia still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before Columbia could fly.

On January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named Challenger. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named Discovery and Atlantis. Construction of OV-105, later named Endeavour, began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the loss of Challenger, NASA resumed production of Endeavour in September 1987.

The Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for reuse. Each Space Shuttle orbiter was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended. At launch, it consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs).

Responsibility for the Shuttle components was spread among multiple NASA field centers. The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the Vandenberg Air Force Base was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the Johnson Space Center (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the John C. Stennis Space Center handled main engine testing, and the Goddard Space Flight Center managed the global tracking network.

The orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-delta wings were 18 m (60 ft) long, and were swept 81¬∞ at the inner leading edge and 45¬∞ at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard elevon to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control pitch. The orbiter's vertical stabilizer was swept backwards at 45¬∞, and contained a rudder that could split to act as a speed brake. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part drag parachute system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used retractable landing gear with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.

The SpaceX Starship is a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX since 2012, as a self-funded private spaceflight project.

The second stage of Starship‚Äîwhich is also commonly referred to as "Starship" is designed as a long-duration cargo and passenger-carrying spacecraft. It is expected to be initially used without any booster stage at all, as part of an extensive development program to prove out launch-and-landing and iterate on a variety of design details, particularly with respect to the vehicle's atmospheric reentry.

While the spacecraft will be tested on its own at suborbital altitudes, it will be used on orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super Heavy, where the spacecraft will serve as the second stage on a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle.

Integrated system testing of a proof of concept for Starship began in March 2019, with the addition of a single Raptor rocket engine to a reduced-height prototype, nicknamed Starhopper ‚Äî similar to Grasshopper, an equivalent prototype of the Falcon 9 reusable booster. Starhopper was used from April through August 2019 for static testing and low-altitude, low-velocity flight testing of vertical launches 
and landings in July and August 2019. More prototype Starships have been built and more are under construction as the iterative design goes through several iterations. All test articles have a 9 meters (30 ft)-diameter stainless steel hull.

SpaceX is planning to launch commercial payloads using Starship no earlier than 2021. In April 2020, NASA selected a modified human rated Starship system as one of three lunar landing systems to receive funding for a 10-month long initial design phase for the Artemis program.

While the name of the vehicle has changed many times over the years, the combination of Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster is called the "Starship system" by SpaceX in their payload users guide. Sometimes, as on the SpaceX website, the term "Starship" is used as a collective term for both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster.

At least as early as 2005, SpaceX used the codename, "BFR", for a conceptual heavy-lift vehicle, "far larger than the Falcon family of vehicles", with a goal of 100 t (220,000 lb) to orbit. Beginning in mid-2013, SpaceX referred to both the mission architecture and the vehicle as the Mars Colonial Transporter. By the time a large 12-meter diameter design concept was unveiled in September 2016, SpaceX had begun referring to the overall system as the Interplanetary Transport System.

With the announcement of a new 9-meter design in September 2017, SpaceX resumed referring to the vehicle as "BFR". Musk said in the announcement, "we are searching for the right name, but the code name, at least, is BFR". SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell subsequently stated that BFR stands for, "Big Falcon Rocket". However, Elon Musk had explained in the past that although BFR is the official name, he drew inspiration from the BFG weapon in the Doom video games. The BFR had also occasionally been referred to informally by the media and internally at SpaceX as "Big Fucking Rocket". At the time, the second stage/spacecraft was referred to as "BFS". The booster first stage was also at times referred to as the "BFB". In November 2018, the spaceship was renamed Starship, and the first stage booster was named Super Heavy.

Notably, in the fashion of SpaceX, even that term "Super Heavy" had been previously used by SpaceX in a different context. In February 2018, at about the time of the first Falcon Heavy launch, Musk had "suggested the possibility of a Falcon Super Heavy ‚Äî a Falcon Heavy with extra boosters. 'We could really dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want. If we wanted to we could actually add two more side boosters and make it Falcon Super Heavy'".

A modified version known as the Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was selected by NASA in April 2020 for potential use for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program. The Starship HLS variant is being designed to stay on and around the Moon and as such both the heat shield and air-brakes ‚Äî integral parts of the main Starship design ‚Äî are not included in the Starship HLS design. The variant will use high-thrust methox RCS thrusters 
located mid-body on Starship HLS during the final "tens of meters" of the terminal lunar descent and landing, and will also include a smaller crew area and a much larger cargo bay, be powered by a solar array located on its nose below the docking port. SpaceX intends to use the same high-thrust RCS thrusters for liftoff from the lunar surface. If built, the HLS variant would be launched to Earth orbit via the Super Heavy booster and would use orbital refueling to reload propellants into Starship HLS for the lunar transit and lunar landing operations. In the 2020 mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander where they would depart and descend to the surface in Starship HLS. After Lunar surface operations, it would ascend using the same Starship HLS vehicle and return the crew to the Orion. Although not confirmed yet, the vehicle in theory could be refueled in orbit to carry more crews and cargo to the surface.

SpaceX is one of three organizations developing their lunar lander designs for the Artemis program over a 10-month period in 2020-2021. If SpaceX completes the milestone-based requirements of the design contract, then NASA will pay SpaceX US$135 million in design development funding. The other teams selected are the 'National Team' ‚Äî led by Blue Origin but including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper ‚Äî with US$579 million in design funding and Dynetics ‚Äî with SNC and other unspecified companies ‚Äî with US$253 million in NASA funding. At the end of the ten month program, NASA will evaluate which contractors will be offered contracts for initial demonstration missions and select firms for development and maturation of lunar lander systems.

Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle, as SpaceX has announced it intends to eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch vehicle and SpaceX Dragon 2 fleet with Starship, which is expected to take cargo to orbit at far lower cost than any other existing launch vehicle, whether from SpaceX or other launch service provider. In November 2019, Elon Musk estimated that fuel will cost US$900,000 per launch and total launch costs could drop as low as US$2 million.

Starship is an architecture designed to do many diverse spaceflight missions, principally due to the very low marginal cost per mission that the fully-reusable spaceflight vehicles bring to spaceflight technology that were absent in the first six decades after humans put technology into space. Specifically, Starship is designed to be used for

Earth-orbit satellite delivery market. In addition to the standard external launch market that SpaceX has been servicing since 2013, the company intends to use Starship to launch the largest portion of its own internet satellite constellation, Starlink, with more than 12,000 satellites intended to be launched by 2026, more than six times the total number of active satellites on orbit in 2018.
Long-duration spaceflights beyond the earth-moon system
Mars transportation, both as cargo ships as well as passenger-carrying transport
Long-duration flights to the outer planets, for cargo and astronauts
Reusable lunar lander, for use transporting astronauts and cargo to and from the Moon's surface and Gateway in lunar orbit via Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS); as well as more advanced heavy cargo lunar use cases that are envisioned by SpaceX but are not any part of the HLS variant that NASA has contracted with SpaceX for early design work.
In 2017, SpaceX mentioned the theoretical ability of using a boosted Starship to carry passengers on suborbital flights between two points on Earth in under one hour, providing commercial long-haul transport on Earth, competing with long-range aircraft. SpaceX however announced no concrete plans to pursue the two stage "Earth-to-Earth" use case. Over two years later, in May 2019, Musk floated the idea of using single-stage Starship to travel up to 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) on Earth-to-Earth flights at speeds approaching Mach 20 (25,000 km/h; 15,000 mph) with an acceptable payload saying it "dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations". In June 2020, Musk estimated that Earth-to-Earth test flights could begin in "2 or 3 years", i.e. 2022 or 2023, and that planning was underway for "floating superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, Moon and hypersonic travel around Earth".

The Starship vehicle has been criticized for not adequately protecting astronauts from ionizing radiation on Mars missions; Musk has stated that he thinks the transit time to Mars will be too brief to lead to an increased risk of cancer, saying "it's not too big of a deal".

The Thor-Delta, also known as Delta DM-19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s. A derivative of the Thor-Able, it was a member of the Thor family of rockets, and the first member of the Delta family.

The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM-19 configuration. The second stage was the Delta, which had been derived from the earlier Able stage. An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage.

The basic design of the original Vanguard upper stages, featuring a pressure-fed nitric acid/UDMH, regeneratively cooled engine, was kept in place, but with an improved AJ10-118 engine. More significantly, the Delta stage featured cold gas attitude control jets allowing it to be stabilized in orbit for restart and more precise burns.

The Thor-Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage. This configuration was reused for many later rockets, and a derivative, the Delta II, remained in service until 2018.

The Thor-Delta launched a number of significant payloads, including the first communications satellite, Echo 1A; the first British satellite, Ariel 1; and the first active direct-relay communications satellite, Telstar 1. All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17. The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B, while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight, which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due to a problem with the second stage.

The Delta IV Heavy (Delta 9250H) is an expendable heavy-lift launch vehicle, the largest type of the Delta IV family and the world's second highest-capacity rocket in operation, behind SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. It is manufactured by United Launch Alliance and was first launched in 2004.

The Delta IV Heavy consists of a central Common Booster Core (CBC), with two additional CBCs as liquid rocket boosters instead of the GEM-60 solid rocket motors used by the Delta IV Medium+ versions. At lift off, all three cores operate at full thrust, and 44 seconds later the center core throttles down to 55% to conserve fuel until booster separation. The boosters burn out at 242 seconds after launch and are separated as the core booster throttles back up to full thrust. The core burns out 86 seconds later, and the second stage completes the ascent to orbit.

The rocket uses three RS-68 engines, one in the central core and one in each booster.

The Delta IV line of rockets was developed by McDonnell Douglas, later United Launch Alliance. The Delta IV Heavy is the most powerful member of the line, which also includes the smaller Delta IV Medium. The Delta IV Heavy can lift 28,370 kg (62,540 lbs) to low Earth orbit and 13,810 kg (30,440 lbs) to geostationary transfer orbit.[8] It is an all liquid-fueled rocket, consisting of an upper stage, one main booster and two strap-on boosters.

The first launch of the Delta IV Heavy in 2004 carried a boilerplate payload and failed to reach intended orbit. Cavitation in the liquid-oxygen propellant lines caused shutdown of both boosters eight seconds early, and the core engine nine seconds early; this resulted in a lower staging velocity for which the second stage was unable to compensate. The payload was left in a lower than intended orbit. Its first operational payload was the DSP-23 satellite, successfully launched in 2007; it was then used to launch a further five visual and electronic reconnaissance satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office through 2013.

In December 2014, the Delta IV Heavy was used to launch an uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft, designated EFT-1. After several delays on 4 December 2014, the mission was successfully launched at 12:05 UTC on 5 December 2014.

LauncherOne is a two stage orbital launch vehicle under development by Virgin Orbit since 2007. It is an air launch to orbit rocket, designed to launch "smallsat" payloads of 300 kilograms (660 lb) into Sun-synchronous orbit, following air launch from a carrier aircraft at high altitude. The first attempted orbital test flight was completed on 25 May 2020, but failed to reach space due to an anomaly that occurred shortly after the vehicle's release from a Boeing 747-400, named Cosmic Girl, over the Pacific Ocean.

The original LauncherOne concept, 2007-2015, for a smaller launch vehicle (200 kilograms (440 lb) to low-Earth orbit) was shelved in 2015 and replaced by a larger rocket design capable of putting a 300 kilograms (660 lb) minisat payload in a 500 kilometres (310 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and small payloads, with an expected cost less than US$12 million.

Virgin Galactic began working on the LauncherOne concept in 2007, and the technical specifications were first described in some detail in late 2009. The LauncherOne configuration was proposed to be an expendable, two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket air-launched from a White Knight Two carrier aircraft. This would make it a similar configuration to that used by Orbital Sciences' Pegasus, or a smaller version of the StratoLaunch air-launched rocket system.

In October 2012, Virgin announced that LauncherOne would be designed so that it could place 200 kilograms (440 lb) in Sun-synchronous orbit. Virgin planned at the time to market the 200 kilograms (440 lb) payload delivery to Sun-synchronous orbit for under US$10,000,000 per mission, while the maximum payload for LEO missions would be somewhat larger at 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).

By 2012, several commercial customers had signed early contracts for launches signaling demand-side support for new small commercial-oriented launch vehicles. These included GeoOptics, Skybox Imaging, Spaceflight Services, and Planetary Resources. Both Surrey Satellite Technology and Sierra Nevada Space Systems were at the time reported to be developing satellite buses "optimized to the design of LauncherOne".

In 2015, Virgin Galactic established a 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2; 1.4 ha) research, development, and manufacturing center for LauncherOne at the Long Beach Airport.

The company reported in March 2015, that they were on schedule to begin test flights of LauncherOne with its NewtonThree engine by the end of 2016, but they did not achieve that objective.

On 25 June 2015, the company signed a contract with OneWeb Ltd. for 39 satellite launches for its satellite constellation with an option for an additional 100 launches, but in 2018 OneWeb canceled all but four, prompting a lawsuit from Virgin Orbit. OneWeb filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020.

News reports in September 2015 indicated that the heavier payload of 200 kg was to be achieved by longer fuel tanks and use of the recently qualified NewtonThree engine, but this also meant that the Virgin-developed carrier aircraft White Knight Two would no longer be able to lift the rocket to launch altitude, so in December 2015, Virgin announced a change to the carrier plane for LauncherOne to carry the heavier payload. The carrier aircraft subsequently was changed to a used Boeing 747-400, 
Cosmic Girl, previously operated by Virgin Galactic's sister company, Virgin Atlantic, and purchased outright by Virgin Group from Boeing upon the expiration of that airframe's lease. The 747 will allow a larger LauncherOne to carry the heavier payloads. The modification work on the company's 747 was expected to be completed in 2016, to be followed by orbital test launches of the rocket in 2017. It was further announced in December 2015 that the revised LauncherOne would utilize the larger NewtonThree rocket engine on the booster stage, with the NewtonFour powering the second stage.

On 2 March 2017, Virgin Galactic announced that its 200-member LauncherOne team was being spun off into a new company called Virgin Orbit. Also, a subsidiary company of Virgin Orbit called Vox Space was created to carry out business which require strict security requirements. As of 2017, the company expected to fly approximately twice a month by 2020.

In September 2017, the first test flights of LauncherOne were delayed to 2018. By June 2018, the VirginOrbit captive carry flight testing campaign for LauncherOne, including a planned drop test of an unfueled rocket, was licensed to begin in July 2018, and could run for up to six months.

In the event, no LauncherOne test flights occurred in 2018 and were delayed further, to December 2019, with only the carrier aircraft beginning to fly in 2018. The first three test flights of Cosmic Girl, including the pylon but not the rocket, happened on 23, 25 and 27 August 2018. A high-speed taxi test, with a rocket mounted beneath the aircraft, took place in early November 2018. The aircraft flew its first test flight with both pylon and rocket attached on 18 November 2018.

The maiden flight of LauncherOne took place on 25 May 2020. The flight failed a few seconds after the ignition of the rocket, and the rocket did not reach space.

Design
LauncherOne is a two-stage air-launched vehicle using two Virgin-designed and built Newton RP-1 / LOX liquid rocket engines. The rocket has a diameter of 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in) for the first stage and 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) for the second stage and payload fairing. The first stage uses one NewtonThree engine, while the upper stage uses one NewtonFour engine.

In October 2019, the company announced plans to develop a three-stage variant that would be capable of launching 100 kg to the Moon, 70 kg to Venus, or 50 kg to Mars.

Engines
Originally, in 2012, the second stage was to be powered by NewtonOne, a 16 kilonewtons (3,500 lbf) thrust engine. It was originally intended that the first stage will be powered by a scaled-up design of the same basic technology as NewtonOne, called NewtonTwo, with 211 kilonewtons (47,500 lbf) of thrust. Both engines had been designed by early 2014, and first articles had been built. NewtonOne was tested up to a full-duration burn of five minutes. NewtonTwo made several short-duration firings by early 2014. Ultimately, however, neither NewtonOne nor NewtonTwo would be used on LauncherOne.

As of 2015, NewtonThree was to be a 260‚Äì335 kilonewtons (58,000‚Äì75,000 lbf)-thrust engine, and began hot-fire testing by March 2015. In June 2015, reports suggested that a NewtonThree would power the first stage of LauncherOne.

By December 2015, Virgin had settled on a design where the first stage would utilize the larger NewtonThree engine on the booster stage, while the NewtonFour engine would power the second stage, and this was confirmed in June 2018 as Virgin Orbit readied for the start of the flight test campaign in the second half of 2018. NewtonThree generate 326.8 kilonewtons (73,500 lbf) of thrust while NewtonFour deliver 26.5 kN (6,000 lbf) to the second stage.

A 25 May 2020 launch failure was attributed to a failure of a high-pressure LOx fuel line in the NewtonThree engine. The broken fuel line caused LOx to stop flowing into the engine leading to the flight being terminated. Issue with the fuel line was addressed though strengthening broken components.

Intended usage
LauncherOne is designed to launch a 300 kilograms (660 lb) payload to a 500 kilometres (310 mi) SSO, suitable for CubeSats and small payloads. Virgin Orbit has also announced the ability of LauncherOne to send payloads into heliocentric orbit for flybys of Mars, Venus or asteroids.

Virgin Orbit integrate payloads at their headquarters in Long Beach, California.

            commercial satellite launches, including to Geostationary transfer orbit.
            
            The launcher was proposed to be 300 feet (91 m) in height, with an advertised price 
            of $180 million per launch. Liberty had a projected payload of 44,500 lbs (20,000 kg) 
            to Low Earth orbit.
            
            The ATK/Astrium Liberty proposal was not initially selected by NASA in the 2011 contract 
            awards to assist development of a commercial space transportation system to replace the 
            Space Shuttle; however, the team continued development in the hope of gaining funding 
            from NASA in future years. On September 13, 2011, NASA and ATK held a joint news 
            conference to announce they had signed an unfunded Space Act Agreement (SAA) to 
            collaborate on the development of the Liberty Transportation System as part of the 
            agency's Commercial Crew Development Round 2 activities. NASA suggested this agreement 
            could "accelerate the availability of U.S. commercial crew transportation capabilities."

            In January 2012 NASA's Commercial Crew office announced ATK had successfully held a Launch 
            System Initial Systems Design (ISD) Review of the Liberty Transportation System, the third 
            of five milestones to be completed under the SAA. The current SAA continued through at 
            least March 2012.
            
            Liberty was not among the vehicles selected for funding announced on August 3, 2012 under 
            the Commercial Crew Integrated Capacity program.[11] ATK's stated goal prior to the CCiCAP 
            award announcement was to begin test launches in 2015, with a crewed flight in 2016. In 
            early August 2012, shortly before NASA announced the selectees for CCDev award, ATK Liberty 
            manager Kent Rominger stated that the program would continue even without CCiCAP funding. 
            However, following the NASA decision not to select Liberty as a design for further 
            government funding, ATK president and CEO Mark DeYoung stated that the company was 
            "'moving on' after the failure to win a NASA contract reassessing their plans and the 
            decision would not cause any financial hardship."
            
            In May 2012 ATK announced that Liberty would indeed be a complete commercial crew 
            transportation system, including the spacecraft, abort system, launch vehicle, and ground 
            and mission operations. The spacecraft was to be narrowly derived from concepts generated 
            during the Orion program, and make use of the Orion Service Module. ATK projected that 
            the first launch could have taken place as early as 2013, with astronauts launching by 
            2015.

            The spacecraft would be made of ATK's composite space shell developed as an alternative 
            to the Orion's aluminum lithium structure. It would carry up to 7 crew members to and 
            from the ISS or other space stations and was designed with commercial customers in mind. 
            Some designs had an integrated unpressurized storage bay in between the crew module and 
            service module that allowed the spacecraft to carry 5000 pounds of cargo in a pressurized 
            container. This cargo would be berthed to the station by the Canadarm 2. It could also 
            carry up to four unpressurized science pallets to be attached to the station by crew 
            members on EVA or the Canadarm 2. The vehicle would rely on an ATK Max Launch Abort System 
            designed for the Orion spacecraft. The spacecraft would be able to launch both crew and 
            cargo like the Shuttle although it would not be able to return said cargo.

The Martin Marietta SM-68A/HGM-25A Titan I was the United States' first multistage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in use from 1959 until 1962. Though the SM-68A was operational for only three years, it spawned numerous follow-on models that were a part of the US arsenal and space launch capability. The Titan I was unique among the Titan models in that it used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants. All subsequent versions used storable propellants instead.

Originally designed as a backup in case the Air Force's SM-65 Atlas missile development ran into problems, the Titan was ultimately beaten into service by Atlas. Deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the Titan's missile silo basing was more survivable than Atlas.

The LGM-25C Titan II would serve in the US nuclear deterrent until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants.

By January 1955, the size of nuclear weapons had been shrinking dramatically, allowing the possibility of building a bomb that could be carried by a missile of reasonable size. The Titan I program began on the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Committee. The committee presented to the United States Air Force (USAF) their findings of the technical feasibility to develop weapons (bombs) and their delivery systems (intercontinental range ballistic missiles) that were completely invulnerable to "surprise" attack.

The reduction in the mass of nuclear warheads allowed full coverage of the entire Sino-Soviet land mass, and the missile control capabilities were also upgraded. The Titan I would be fully independent in controlled flight from launch to the ballistic release of the warhead, which would descend to its target by the combination of gravity and air resistance alone. In May 1955 the Air Material Command invited contractors to submit proposals and bids for the two stage Titan I ICBM, formally beginning the program. In September 1955, The Martin Company was declared the contractor for the Titan missile. In early October the Air Force's Western Development Division was ordered to start work. The Titan was developed in parallel with the Atlas (SM-65/HGM-16) ICBM, serving as a backup with potentially greater capabilities and an incentive for the Atlas contractor to work harder. Martin was selected as the contractor due to its proposed organization and method of igniting a liquid fueled engine at high altitude.

The Titan I was initially designated as a bomber aircraft (B-68), but was later designated SM-68 Titan and finally HGM-25A in 1962.

The previous strategic missile programs of the Air Force had been administered using the "single prime contractor concept" (later called the weapon system concept). This had resulted in three badly botched programs; the programs of the Snark, Navaho and RASCAL missiles had slipped an average of 5 years and had cost overruns of 300 per cent or more. In response, the Teapot Committee was tasked with evaluating requirements for ballistic missiles and methods of accelerating their development. As a result of the ensuing recommendations, the USAF established the Western Development Division and Brigadier General Bernard Schriever was detailed to command it. Schriever devised an entirely new organization for program management. The Air Force was to act as "prime contractor," the Ramo-Woolridge Corporation was contracted to provide systems engineering and technical direction of all ballistic missiles. The airframe contractor also would assemble the sub-systems provided by other Air Force contractors. At the time, this new organization was very controversial.

The Titan I represented an evolution of technology when compared to the Atlas missile program, but shared many of the Atlas' problems. The liquid oxygen oxidizer could not be stored for long periods of time, increasing the response time as the missile had to be raised out of its silo and loaded with oxidizer before a launch could occur. The main improvements of the Titan I over the first Atlas's deployed were vertical storage in a fully underground silo and an improved fully internal inertial guidance system. Later Atlas E/F models were equipped with what would have been the Titan I's guidance system The Titan I would be deployed with the Bell Labs radio-inertial guidance system.

The Titan II GLV (Gemini Launch Vehicle) or Gemini-Titan II was an American expendable launch system derived from the Titan II missile, which was used to launch twelve Gemini missions for NASA between 1964 and 1966. Two uncrewed launches followed by ten crewed ones were conducted from Launch Complex 19 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, starting with Gemini 1 on April 8, 1964.

The Titan II was a two-stage liquid-fuel rocket, using a hypergolic propellant combination of Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. The first stage was powered by an LR87 engine (with two combustion chambers and nozzles, fed by a single set of turbomachinery), and the second stage was propelled by an LR-91 engine.

The Titan 23G, Titan II(23)G, Titan 2(23)G or Titan II SLV was an American expendable launch system derived from the LGM-25C Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile. Retired Titan II missiles were converted by Martin Marietta, into which the Glenn L. Martin Company, which built the original Titan II, had merged. It was used to carry payloads for the United States Air Force, NASA and NOAA. Thirteen were launched from Space Launch Complex 4W at the Vandenberg Air Force Base between 1988 and 2003.

Titan 23G rockets consisted of two stages burning liquid propellant. The first stage was powered by one Aerojet LR87 engine with two combustion chambers and nozzles, and the second stage was propelled by an LR91. On some flights, the spacecraft included a kick motor, usually the Star-37XFP-ISS; however, the Star-37S was also used.

A contract to refurbish fourteen Titan II missiles to the Titan 23G configuration was awarded to Martin Marietta in January 1986. The first launch occurred on 5 September 1988, carrying a classified payload for the US National Reconnaissance Office. Thirteen were launched, with the fourteenth going to the Evergreen Aviation Museum. The final flight occurred on 17 October 2003, carrying a DMSP satellite.

During refurbishment, the forward structure of the second stage was modified with the addition of a payload attachment fitting to attach the payload to the rocket, and installing a payload fairing to protect it during launch. The engines were refurbished, and the rockets' guidance and control systems were upgraded by Delco Electronics.

The former Titan IIIB pad at Vandenberg, SLC-4W, was modified to accommodate the Titan 23G, and was used for all thirteen launches.

Titan IIIB was the collective name for a number of derivatives of the Titan II ICBM and Titan III launch vehicle, modified by the addition of an Agena upper stage. It consisted of four separate rockets. The Titan 23B was a basic Titan II with an Agena upper stage, and the Titan 24B was the same concept, but using the slightly enlarged Titan IIIM rocket as the base. The Titan 33B was a Titan 23B with the Agena (which had a smaller diameter than the Titan) enclosed in an enlarged fairing, in order to allow larger payloads to be launched. The final member of the Titan IIIB family was the Titan 34B which was a Titan 24B with the larger fairing used on the Titan 33B.

The Titan 23B space launch vehicle was a three-stage liquid fueled booster, designed to provide a small-to-medium weight class capability. It was able to lift approximately 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) into a polar low-Earth circular orbit. The first stage consisted of a ground ignited Aerojet LR-87 liquid propellant rocket, while the second stage consisted of an LR91 liquid propellant rocket. The third stage was an Agena D XLR81-BA-9 liquid propellant rocket.

Various models of this Titan/Agena D rocket were called, "Titan 23B", "Titan 24B", "Titan 33B" and "Titan 34B".

Background
The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955, when the Air Force awarded The Martin Company a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It became known as the Titan I, the nation's first two-stage ICBM and first underground silo-based ICBM. More than 140 Titan II ICBMs, once the vanguard of America's strategic deterrent force, were built. Titan IIs also were flown in NASA's Gemini manned space program in the mid-1960s. The Titan 23B is a derivative of the Titan II vehicle with an Agena D upper stage added.

The Titan IIIB family emerged when the new KH-8 (Gambit Mark 3) photo reconnaissance satellite was being developed as the successor to the KH-7 Gambit Mark 1/2 which began flying in 1963. It was decided to switch to the Titan family over the Atlas used for KH-7 because it had substantially more lift capability and also its conventional two-stage design and hypergolic propellants made for a simpler and more reliable launch vehicle than the quirky Atlas. The KH-8 was double the size of its predecessor but still well below the Titan's lift capability.

While the KH-8 was the original raison d'√™tre for the Titan IIIB's existence, as well as its primary payload, the booster was also used for Jumpseat SIGINT satellites and military comsats. It also lived up to its promise of greater reliability than the Thor and Atlas, with only a few failures over its run.

Primary function: Launch vehicle used to lift medium class satellites into space.

Titan 23B
Titan 23B used the basic Titan 3A core with an Agena D upper stage. The Titan 23B was launched from SLC-4W at Vandenberg AFB, Calif. Its main payload was the GAMBIT (KH-8 reconnaissance) satellites, although the final two 23B vehicles carried Jumpseat SIGNIT satellites and had some minor upper stage modifications for them. 33 flights were made from 1966 to 1971, with one failure.

Titan 24B
The Titan 24B differed from the Titan 23B in that the Titan IIIM core with extended propellant tanks was used in place of the original Titan II core. The payload remained attached to the Agena stage. 23 flights took place from 1971‚Äì84, with two failures.

Titan 33B
The Titan 33B was a Titan 23B with the entire Agena and payload completely enclosed in a shroud. It flew only three times (1971‚Äì73) with one failure and was used to launch Jumpseat satellites.

Titan 34B
The Titan 34B was a Titan 24B, modified by the addition of the larger fairing used on the Titan 33B. 23 were launched in 1971-87 with two failures. All launches consisted of KH-8 satellites.

Derived from the Titan III, the Titan 34D featured Stage 1 and Stage 2 stretched with more powerful UA1206 solid motors. A variety of upper stages were available, including the Inertial Upper Stage, the Transfer Orbit Stage, and the Transtage.[1] The Titan 34D made its maiden flight in the year of 1982 on the 30th of October with two DSCS defense communications satellites for the United States Department of Defense (DOD).

All of the launches were conducted from either LC-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station or SLC-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Overall, fifteen launches were carried out, of which three failed.

1985 failure, Titan 34D-7
The first failure was a launch of a KH-11 photoreconnaissance satellite in the year of 1985 on the 28th of August. The core stage suffered a propulsion system malfunction and was destroyed by Range Safety. The flight proceeded normally until the core engine start at T+108 seconds. At T+112 seconds, an abnormal start transient occurred and Engine 2 began experiencing thrust decay. At T+212 seconds, Engine 1 shut down, causing loss of attitude control. The onboard computer shut off Engine 2 at T+256 seconds and began a premature separation and ignition of Stage 2. With the Titan now tumbling and headed back towards land, the destruct command was issued at T+272 seconds and the KH-11 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. During Stage 1's powered flight, the oxidizer tank began leaking N
2O
4 which was thought to have resulted in loss of lubrication to the Engine 1 turbopump and breakdown of the pinion gear. The attempts by the Navy to salvage booster debris from the ocean floor were largely unsuccessful. Investigators also complained that tracking camera coverage during the core stage burn was inadequate.

Titan 34D-7 was the first failed launch of a solid motor-equipped Titan vehicle from Vandenberg (there had been several failures from Cape Canaveral over the years) and was particularly vexing because of inadequate launch data. The Titan III's flawless West Coast launch record meant that the Air Force felt confident enough to remove several telemetry measurements from the boosters in the interest of reduced weight and complexity. There had evidently been leaks from both the fuel and oxidizer tanks, as well as suspicion hinged on clamps that held the propellant feed lines in place. However, the clamps had not failed on any previous launches so it was not clear why they would suddenly fail now. Some members on the investigative board even proposed that the SRBs had suffered an exhaust gas leak which caused damage to the core stage. As evidence, they noted that a piece of cork insulation had broken off one SRB shortly after launch. The official cause of the failure was "Leakage of oxidizer resulting in loss of turbopump lubrication and breakdown of the pinion gear." However, most of the members of the investigative team were unsatisfied with this verdict.

As a result of 34D-7, the Air Force took measures to ensure that a repeat failure would not occur. These included reinstalling some of the deleted telemetry probes on the Titan as well as improved camera coverage; the next launch would even have the aircraft flying overhead to provide additional photography.

1986 failure, Titan 34D-9
Titan 34D-9 was prepared for launch in the year 1986 on the 18th of April. Instead of the advanced KH-11 satellite carried on 34D-7, this booster would have the older model KH-9, in what would be the final launch of that satellite and the final launch of a film capsule photoreconnaissance satellite by the United States. One hundred and twenty people were gathered in the blockhouse on a clear, cloudless Friday morning, a rare situation for the normally foggy California coast. Liftoff took place at 10:45 AM Pacific Time. It only took a few seconds for disaster to strike as the Titan catastrophically exploded just above SLC-4E, showering the launch complex as well as the adjacent SLC-4W (used for Titan IIIB launches) with debris and toxic propellant.

Investigation quickly provided an anatomy of the failure. The right solid rocket motor ruptured starting at T+6 seconds and the resulting torque on the launch vehicle caused the left SRM to break away. This triggered its automatic destruct system, blowing the Stage 1 to pieces and rupturing the Stage 2's N
2O
4 tank. The upper stages were ejected and launched through the air until a manual destruct command was sent by the range safety officer at T+20 seconds. The KH-9 was also blown up by its internal self-destruct mechanism, which was designed to destroy the classified satellite in the event of a launch malfunction. Debris rained onto SLC-4E, badly damaging the launch complex in the process and starting numerous small fires -- some of which burned for up to two days. Extracting launch personnel from the blockhouse proved difficult due to the area around the pad being filled with toxic fumes and burning debris. The right SRB had come down largely intact onto a concrete structure near the pad, which had nobody inside it at the time of launch (the casing rupture had damaged the Inadvertent Separation Destruct System [ISDS] lanyards and prevented proper destruction of the SRM).

The disaster drew comparisons to the Challenger shuttle accident three months earlier, which was also the victim of a solid rocket motor malfunction. However, the Titan incident was found to have a rather different cause as it had not suffered an O-ring burn-through, but instead the culprit was a small air pocket between the SRM propellant and its metal motor casing. This allowed hot exhaust gases to burn through the casing and eventually rupture the SRM. The loss of two photoreconnaissance satellites in a row also badly hampered American efforts to acquire intelligence on Soviet activities.

The Air Force, prior to finding out the true cause of 34D-9's failure, was so puzzled at the loss of two Titan IIIs in a row that it believed for a time that saboteurs had been at work on Vandenberg Air Force Base, and it had base personnel comb the nearby hills for bullet casings.

Due to the classified payload, extensive efforts were made to clean up all remains of the KH-9, whose film reels were ripped apart into hundreds of small pieces and scattered around the pad area. The satellite debris was taken away for burial in an undisclosed location in the State of Nevada.

Investigation found that the manufacturer of the UA1206 motors, Chemical Systems Division of United Technologies, had virtually forgotten proper quality control measures. Due to the Shuttle program, demand for expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) was greatly reduced during the 1980s and manufacturers had been cutting costs, dropping technical personnel, and preparing to phase out ELVs. However, the Challenger disaster created a renewed emphasis on ELVs and would see a considerable expansion of the upcoming Titan IV program, which was originally intended for just ten launches.

The exact reason for the air pocket in the #2 SRM was never satisfactorily determined. While all of the rocket segments were at least five years old (since all flight article Titan 34Ds had been manufactured and delivered by 1982 and the production line long since shut down), there had been no similar problems on other SRMs of the same age. Thanks to Titan 34D-9 (and because an SRB malfunction was a possible cause of 34D-7's failure), more stringent measures were put in place which included X-raying SRM segments on Titans to ensure proper operating condition before launch.

SLC-4E was out of commission until October 1987, after which it was the site of the remaining two Titan 34D launches without incident.

The Commercial Titan III, also known as CT-3 or CT-III, was an American expendable launch system, developed by Martin Marietta during the late 1980s and flown four times during the early 1990s. It was derived from the Titan 34D, and was originally proposed as a medium-lift expendable launch system for the US Air Force, who selected the Delta II instead. Development was continued as a commercial launch system, and the first rocket flew in 1990. Due to higher costs than contemporary rockets such as the Ariane 4, orders were not forthcoming, and the CT-3 was retired in 1992.[citation needed]

The Commercial Titan III differed from the Titan 34D in that it had a stretched second stage, and a larger payload fairing to accommodate dual satellite payloads.

All four launches occurred from LC-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The first carried two communications satellites, Skynet 4A and JCSAT-2, and was launched at 00:07 UTC on 1 January 1990, which was 19:07 local time on 31 December 1989, making it the only orbital launch to have occurred in different years between the launch site and UTC.[citation needed] The launch received the International Designator 1990-001, using the UTC date.

The second launch occurred on 14 March, and carried the Intelsat 603 satellite. The rocket's second stage failed to separate, and the payload could only be released from the rocket by means of jettisoning its kick motor. It was later visited by Space Shuttle Endeavour, on mission STS-49. Astronauts attached a new kick motor, which raised the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, as had originally been planned.

The third launch, on 23 June, carried Intelsat 604, and was successful. There was no Commercial Titan III launch in 1991, due to maintenance work at Launch Complex 40.[citation needed]

The final flight of the Commercial Titan III occurred on 25 September 1992, and placed NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft into heliocentric orbit, by means of a Transfer Orbit Stage.

Titan IV was a family of heavy-lift space launch vehicles developed by Martin Marietta and operated by the United States Air Force from 1989 to 2005.[ Launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

The Titan IV was the last of the Titan family of rockets, originally developed by the Glenn L. Martin Company in 1958. It was retired in 2005 due to their high cost of operation and concerns over its toxic propellant fuels, and replaced with the Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles under the EELV program. The final launch (B-30) from Cape Canaveral occurred on 29 April 2005, and the final launch from Vandenberg AFB occurred on 19 October 2005. Lockheed Martin Space Systems built the Titan IVs near Denver, Colorado, under contract to the US government.

Two Titan IV vehicles are currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio and the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.

The Titan IV was developed to provide assured capability to launch Space Shuttle‚Äìclass payloads for the Air Force. The Titan IV could be launched with no upper stage, the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), or the Centaur upper stage.

The Titan IV was made up of two large solid-fuel rocket boosters and a two-stage liquid-fueled core. The two storable liquid fuel core stages used Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. These propellants are hypergolic (ignite on contact) and are liquids at room temperature, so no tank insulation is needed. This allowed the launcher to be stored in a ready state for extended periods, but both propellants are extremely toxic.

The Titan IV could be launched from either coast: SLC-40 or 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station near Cocoa Beach, Florida and at SLC-4E, at Vandenberg Air Force Base launch sites 55 miles northwest of Santa Barbara California. Launches to polar orbits occurred from Vandenberg, with most other launches taking place at Cape Canaveral.

Titan IV-A
Titan IV-A flew with steel-cased solid rocket motors (SRMs) produced by Chemical Systems Division.

Titan IV-B
Years later, the Titan IV-B evolved from the Titan III family and was similar to the Titan 34D. While the launcher family had an extremely good reliability record in its first two decades, this changed in the 1980s with the loss of a Titan 34D in 1985 followed by the disastrous explosion of another in 1986 due to a SRM failure.

The Titan IV-B vehicle was intended to use the new composite-casing SRMs manufactured by Alliant Technologies. However, after numerous development problems the first few Titan IV-B launches flew with the old-style SRMs.

The Titan rocket family was established in October 1955 when the Air Force awarded the Glenn L. Martin Company (later Martin-Marietta, now part of Lockheed Martin) a contract to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (SM-68). The resulting Titan I was the nation's first two-stage ICBM and complemented the Atlas ICBM as the second underground, vertically stored, silo-based ICBM. Both stages of the Titan I used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants.

A subsequent version of the Titan family, the Titan II, was a two-stage evolution of the Titan I, but was much more powerful and used different propellants. Designated as LGM-25C, the Titan II was the largest missile developed for the USAF at that time. The Titan II had newly developed engines which used Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide as fuel and oxidizer in a self-igniting, hypergolic propellant combination, allowing the Titan II to be stored underground ready to launch. Titan II was the first Titan vehicle to be used as a space launcher.

Development of the space launch only Titan III began in 1964, resulting in the Titan IIIA, eventually followed by the Titan IV-A and IV-B.

Titan IV development
By the mid-1980s the United States government worried that the Space Shuttle, designed to launch all American payloads and replace all unmanned rockets, would not be reliable enough for military and classified missions. In 1984 Under Secretary of the Air Force and Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Pete Aldridge decided to purchase Complementary Expendable Launch Vehicles (CELV) for ten NRO payloads; the name came from the government's expectation that the rockets would "complement" the shuttle. Later renamed Titan IV, the rocket would only carry three military payloads[10] paired with Centaur stages and fly exclusively from LC-41 at Cape Canaveral. However, the Challenger accident in 1986 caused a renewed dependence on expendable launch systems, with the Titan IV program significantly expanded. At the time of its introduction, the Titan IV was the largest and most capable expendable launch vehicle used by the USAF.

The post-Challenger program added Titan IV versions with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) or no upper stages, increased the number of flights, and converted LC-40 at the Cape for Titan IV launches. As of 1991, almost forty total Titan IV launches were scheduled and a new, improved SRM (solid rocket motor) casing using lightweight composite materials was introduced.

Program cost
In 1990, the Titan IV Selected Acquisition Report estimated the total cost for the acquisition of 65 Titan IV vehicles over a period of 16 years to US$18.3 billion (inflation-adjusted US$ 35.8 billion in 2020).

Cassini‚ÄìHuygens launch
In October 1997, a Titan IV-B rocket launched Cassini‚ÄìHuygens, a pair of probes sent to Saturn. It was the only use of a Titan IV for a non-Department of Defense launch. Huygens landed on Titan on January 14, 2005. Cassini remained in orbit around Saturn. The Cassini Mission ended on September 15, 2017 when the spacecraft was manoeuvered into Saturn's atmosphere to burn up.

Retirement
While an improvement over the shuttle, the Titan IV was expensive and unreliable. By the 1990s, there were also growing safety concerns over its toxic propellants. The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program resulted in the development of the Atlas V, Delta IV, and Delta IV Heavy launch vehicles, which replaced Titan IV and a number of other legacy launch systems. The new EELVs eliminated the use of hypergolic propellants, reduced costs, and are much more versatile than the legacy vehicles.

Surviving examples
In 2014, the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, began a project to restore a Titan IV-B rocket. This effort was successful, with the display opening June 8, 2016. The only other surviving Titan IV components are on outdoor display at the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, including the core stages and parts of the solid rocket motor assembly.

The Vanguard rocket was intended to be the first launch vehicle the United States would use to place a satellite into orbit. Instead, the Sputnik crisis caused by the surprise launch of Sputnik 1 led the U.S., after the failure of Vanguard TV-3, to quickly orbit the Explorer 1 satellite using a Juno I rocket, making Vanguard 1 the second successful U.S. orbital launch.

Vanguard rockets were used by Project Vanguard from 1957 to 1959. Of the eleven Vanguard rockets which the project attempted to launch, three successfully placed satellites into orbit. Vanguard rockets were an important part of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In 1955, the United States announced plans to put a scientific satellite in orbit for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957‚Äì1958. The goal was to track the satellite as it performed experiments. At that time, there were three candidates for the launch vehicle: The Air Force's SM-65 Atlas, a derivative of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's SSM-A-14 Redstone, and a Navy proposal for a three-stage rocket based on the RTV-N-12a Viking sounding rocket.

The RAND Corporation, Air Force and CIA had long pursued the idea of a reconnaissance satellite. Such a program was under way, Weapon System 117L, which was top secret compartmented. One problem with reconnaissance was the question of legality: Was there "freedom of space" or did a nation's airspace end when space is entered? The National Security Council backed the IGY satellite because it would make good cover for WS117L and set a precedent of freedom of space peaceful civilian satellite. At the same time the NSC stressed that the IGY satellite must not interfere with military programs. The Army's Redstone-based proposal would likely be the first one ready for a satellite launch. Its connection with German-born scientist Wernher von Braun, however, was a public-relations risk. In any case, the Atlas and Redstone ballistic missiles were top-priority military projects, which were not to be hindered by pursuing a secondary space launch mission. Milton Rosen's Vanguard was a project at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), which was regarded more as a scientific than a military organization. Rosen and Richard Porter (IGY satellite chief and head of the American Rocket Society) both lobbied for the Vanguard and against using the Atlas or von Braun's rockets. They emphasized the non-military goals of the satellite program. Besides the public-relations aspect, a non-military satellite was considered important, because a discussion of whether overflights of foreign countries by satellites were legal or illegal was to be avoided.

In August or September 1955, the DOD Committee on Special Capabilities chose the NRL proposal, named Vanguard, for the IGY project. The Martin company, which had also built the Viking, became prime contractor for the launch vehicle. The Vanguard rocket was designed as a three-stage vehicle. The first stage was a General Electric X-405 liquid-fueled engine (designated XLR50-GE-2 by the Navy), derived from the engine of the RTV-N-12a Viking. The second stage was the Aerojet General AJ10-37 (XLR52-AJ-2) liquid-fueled engine, a variant of the engine in the RTV-N-10 Aerobee. Finally, the third stage was a solid-propellant rocket motor. All three-stage Vanguard flights except the last one used a motor built by the Grand Central Rocket Company. Vanguard had no fins, and the first and second stages were steered by gimbaled engines. The second stage housed the vehicle's telemetry system, the inertial guidance system and the autopilot. The third stage was spin-stabilized, with the spin imparted by a turntable on the second stage before separation.

The Vanguard's second stage served for decades as the Able and Delta second stage for satellite launch vehicles. The AJ10 engine which made up those stages was adapted into the AJ10-137, which was used as the Apollo Service Module engine. The AJ10-190, adapted from the Apollo spacecraft was used on the Space Shuttle for orbital maneuvers. The AJ10-160 is to be repurposed for use on NASA's upcoming Orion spacecraft.

The first two flights of the Vanguard program, designated Vanguard TV-0 and Vanguard TV-1, were actually the last two remaining RTV-N-12a Viking rockets modified. Vanguard TV-0, launched on 8 December 1956, primarily tested new telemetry systems, while Vanguard TV-1 on 1 May 1957, was a two-stage vehicle testing separation and ignition of the solid-fueled upper stage of Vanguard. Vanguard TV-2, launched on 23 October 1957, after several abortive attempts, was the first real Vanguard rocket. The second and third stages were inert, but the flight successfully tested first/second-stage separation and spin-up of the third stage. However, by that time, the Soviet Union had already placed the Sputnik 1 satellite into orbit, and so project Vanguard was more or less forced to launch its own satellite as soon as possible. Therefore, a very small experimental satellite (derisively called the "grapefruit" by Nikita Khrushchev, and weighing only 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb)) was added to Vanguard TV-3, which was to be the first test of an all-up Vanguard rocket. Although the NRL and Glenn L. Martin Company tried to emphasize that the Vanguard TV-3 mission was a pure test flight (and one with several "firsts"), everyone else saw it as the first satellite launch of the Western world, billed as "America's answer to Sputnik". Wernher von Braun angrily said about the Sputnik launch: "We knew they were going to do it. Vanguard will never make it. We have the hardware on the shelf. We can put up a satellite in 60 days".

On 6 December 1957, the US Navy launched Vanguard TV-3 rocket, carrying a 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb) satellite, from Cape Canaveral. It only reached an altitude of 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) before it fell and exploded. The satellite was exploded from the top of the rocket, landed in bushes near the pad, and began transmitting signals, leading New York Journal-American columnist Dorothy Kilgallen to remark "Why doesn't somebody go out there, find it, and shoot it?" The American press called it Kaputnik.


Investigation into the accident concluded that inadequate fuel tank pressure had allowed hot exhaust gases to back up into the injector head and destroy it, causing complete loss of engine thrust. After the failure of Vanguard TV-3, the backup vehicle, Vanguard TV-3BU (BU=BackUp), was prepared for another attempt. Pad crews hastened to repair the damage done to LC-18A by Vanguard TV-3's explosion, and in the third week of January 1958, the job was completed. Vanguard TV-3BU was erected on the pad, but continuous delays frustrated the launch attempt. Heavy rains shorted some electrical cables on the ground and necessitated their replacement. The second stage had also been sitting on the pad with a full load of nitric acid for several weeks, which eventually corroded the fuel tank and valves. It had to be removed and replaced by a different stage. Finally, the launch got under way on the night of 5 February 1958. The Vanguard lifted smoothly into the sky and performed well until 57 seconds into launch, when the booster pitched over almost 40¬∞. The skinny second stage broke in half from aerodynamic stress four seconds later, causing the Vanguard to tumble end-over-end before range safety officer sent the destruct command. Cause of the failure was attributed to a spurious guidance signal that caused the first stage to perform unintended pitch maneuvers. The guidance system was modified to have greater redundancy, and efforts were made to improve quality control. On 17 March 1958, Vanguard TV-4 finally succeeded in orbiting the Vanguard 1 satellite. By that time, however, the Army's Juno (Jupiter-C) had already launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1. The Vanguard TV-4 rocket had put the satellite Vanguard 1, to a relatively high orbit of (3,966 by 653 kilometres (2,464 mi √ó 406 mi)). Vanguard 1 and its third stage remain in orbit as the oldest man-made artifacts in space. The following four flights, TV-5 and SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) Vanguard SLV-1, Vanguard SLV-2 and Vanguard SLV-3 all failed, but on 17 February 1959, Vanguard SLV-4 launched Vanguard 2, weighing 10.8 kilograms (24 lb), into orbit. The SLVs were the "production" Vanguard rockets. Vanguard SLV-5 and Vanguard SLV-6 also failed, but the final flight on 18 September 1959, successfully orbited the 24 kilograms (53 lb) Vanguard 3 satellite. That last mission was designated Vanguard TV-4BU, because it used a remaining test vehicle, which had been upgraded with a new third stage, the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory X-248A2 Altair. This more powerful motor enabled the launch of the heavier payload. The combination of the AJ10 liquid engine and X-248 solid motor was also used, under the name Able, as an upper stage combination for Thor and Atlas space launch vehicles.

Vector-R (Vector Rapid) was a two-stage orbital expendable launch vehicle under development by the American aerospace company Vector Launch to cover the commercial small satellite launch segment (CubeSats). Vector Launch went bankrupt in December 2019 and the development of Vector-R was stopped. The rocket did not perform any orbital flights. Two prototypes were launched to very low altitudes in 2017.

The rocket completed a maiden test flight at low altitude in May 2017. Vector Launch was planning the maiden orbital launch from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska in 2019, but paused operation in August 2019 due to an uncertain financing situation. Vector Launch declared bankruptcy in December 2019, cancelling all development activity of the Vector-R.

An upgraded version of the Vector-R, called the Vector-H (Heavy), was in development as well.

Vector-R was planned to use two stages with a 1.2-meter (3.9 ft) diameter first stage and 0.635-meter (2.08 ft) diameter second stage, both filled with propylene/LOX propellant. The main body of the rocket was to be constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.

The launch vehicle's first stage was to be powered by three LP-1 LOX/propylene engines, delivering 81,000 newtons of force. The second stage was to be powered by one LP-2 LOX/propylene engine, delivering 4,400 newtons of force. The engines used a 3D-printed engine injector, designed with help from NASA's Science, Technology and Mission Directorate (STMD) Flight Opportunities program. This allows the injector to be produced as a single piece of hardware, instead of as individual components.[citation needed]

Vector was aiming the rocket at a launch cadence of 100 vehicles per year.

Block 0.1
The first two sub-orbital flight tests used the Vector-R Block 0.1 prototype model, which was a full size aluminium air-frame of the Vector-R but with only one first stage engine.

Vector-RE1
The Vector-RE1, a planned variant, was planned to use the same body as the standard Vector-R but include an electric powered third stage.

Intended usage
Vector-R was designed to launch a 60 kg (130 lb) payload to a 1,000 km (620 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small satellites. The cost per launch was planned to be less than US$3 million, a price point that the company hoped would have allowed it to attract one hundred launches per year. Customers could have chosen to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which could be attached to the rocket shortly before launch, in several different configurations, such as fitting CubeSats dispensers or multiple satellites in a single fairing.

Vector used on-site payload integration for the early launches. However it was expected to be able to integrate payloads at their Arizona and California payload facilities and ship them to their launch sites.

Vulcan Centaur is a two-stage-to-orbit heavy-lift launch vehicle under development 2014‚Äì2020 by United Launch Alliance (ULA), principally funded through National Security Space Launch (NSSL) competition and launch program, to meet the demands of the United States Air Force and US national security satellite launches.

The maiden flight is planned to take place in July 2021, launching Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander.

Vulcan is ULA's first launch vehicle design, adapting and evolving various technologies previously developed for the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets of the USAF's EELV program. The first stage propellant tanks share the diameter of the Delta IV Common Booster Core, but will contain liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellants instead of the Delta IV's liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

Vulcan's upper stage is the Centaur V, an upgraded variant of the Common Centaur/Centaur III currently used on the Atlas V. A lengthened version of the Centaur V will be used on the Vulcan Centaur Heavy. Current plans call for the Centaur V to be eventually upgraded with Integrated Vehicle Fluids technology to become the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES). Vulcan is intended to undergo the human-rating certification process to allow the launch of crew, such as the Boeing CST-100 Starliner or a future crewed version of the Sierra Nevada Dream Chaser spaceplane.

The Vulcan booster will have a 5.4 m (18 ft) outer diameter to support the methane fuel burned by the Blue Origin BE-4 engines. The BE-4 was selected to power Vulcan's first stage in September 2018 after a competition with the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR1.

Zero to sixGEM-63XL solid rocket boosters (SRB)s can be attached to the first stage in pairs, providing additional thrust during the first part of the flight and allowing the six-SRB Vulcan Centaur Heavy to launch a higher mass payload than the most capable Atlas V 551 or Delta IV Heavy.

Vulcan will have a 5.4 m (18 ft) diameter fairing available in two lengths. The longer fairing will be 21 m (69 ft) long, with a volume of 317 m3 (11,200 cu ft).
