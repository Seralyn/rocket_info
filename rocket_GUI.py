            Saturn V was an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle 
            certified for human-rating used by NASA between 1967 and 
            1973. It consisted of three stages, each fueled by liquid 
            propellants. It was developed to support the Apollo program 
            for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to 
            launch Skylab, the first American space station.
    
            The Saturn V was launched 13 times from Kennedy Space Center 
            with no loss of crew or payload. As of 2020, the Saturn V 
            remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest 
            total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, 
            and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and 
            largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of 
            310,000 lb (140,000 kg), which included the third stage 
            and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command 
            and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon.
    
            As the largest production model of the Saturn family of 
            rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of 
            Wernher von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
            Huntsville, Alabama, with Boeing, North American Aviation, 
            Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors.
    
            To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry 
            humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15 flight-capable 
            vehicles were built, but only 13 were flown. An additional 
            three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes. A total 
            of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon in the four years 
            spanning December 1968 through December 1972.

            Soyuz is a series of spacecraft designed for the Soviet space 
            program by the Korolev Design Bureau (now RKK Energia) in the
            1960s that remains in service today, having made more than 140 
            flights. The Soyuz succeeded the Voskhod spacecraft and was 
            originally built as part of the Soviet crewed lunar programs. 
            The Soyuz spacecraft is launched on a Soyuz rocket, the most 
            reliable launch vehicle in the world to date. The Soyuz 
            rocket design is based on the Vostok launcher, which in turn was 
            based on the 8K74 or R-7A Semyorka, a Soviet intercontinental 
            ballistic missile. All Soyuz spacecraft are launched from the 
            Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. After the retirement of the 
            Space Shuttle in 2011, the Soyuz served as the only means for 
            Americans to make crewed space flights until the first flight 
            of VSS Unity in 2018, and the only means for Americans to reach 
            the International Space Station until the first flight of Dragon 
            2 Crew variant on May 30, 2020. The Soyuz is heavily used in 
            the ISS program.
    
            The first Soyuz flight was uncrewed and started on November 28, 
            1966. The first Soyuz mission with a crew, Soyuz 1, launched on 
            23 April 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure, 
            killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. The following flight was 
            uncrewed. Soyuz 3, launched on October 26, 1968, became the 
            program's first successful crewed mission. The only other flight 
            to suffer a fatal accident, Soyuz 11, killed its crew of three 
            when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry. 
            These were the only humans to date to have died above the Kármán 
            line. Despite these early incidents, Soyuz is widely considered 
            the world's safest, most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle, 
            established by its unparalleled length of operational history. 
            Soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from Salyut 
            and later Mir Soviet space stations, and are now used for transport 
            to and from the International Space Station (ISS). At least one Soyuz 
            spacecraft is docked to ISS at all times for use as an escape craft 
            in the event of an emergency. The spacecraft is intended to be 
            replaced by the six-person Orel spacecraft.

            The Delta III rocket was an expendable launch vehicle made by 
            Boeing. The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of 
            its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, 
            though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted 
            orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta 
            III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to 
            geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its 
            predecessor, the Delta II. Under the 4-digit designation system 
            from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the 
            Delta 8930.
    
            Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene 
            and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main 
            engine with two vernier engines for roll control. While the 
            propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical 
            to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased 
            from 2.4 meters to 4 meters. This reduced the overall length of 
            the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch 
            facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications. First 
            stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, 
            sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). 
            These were 14.7 meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, 
            and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about 6 metric tons more than 
            the Delta II's standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch 
            pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and 
            separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, 
            three of the boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would 
            later find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.

            more likely, 2021. When development is completed, it will 
            become the newest member in the Ariane launch vehicle family. 
            The final design was selected in December 2014, favoring a 
            liquid-fuelled core with large solid rocket boosters over the 
            initial solid-fuel rocket design. The motivation for 
            Ariane 6 development was to replace Ariane 5 at half the cost, 
            and allow double the number of launches each year.
            
            Ariane 6 was initially conceived in the early 2010s as a 
            replacement launch vehicle for Ariane 5, and a number of 
            concepts and high-level designs were suggested and proposed 
            during 2012–2015. Funding from several European governments 
            was secured by early 2016, and contracts were signed to begin 
            detailed design and the build of test articles. While in 2019, 
            the maiden orbital flight had been planned for 2020, by May 
            2020, the planned initial launch date had been delayed until 2021.

            launching satellites into orbit. The launch site was 
            located at the Alcântara Launch Center due to its 
            proximity to the equator.
    
            Associated vehicles include the Sonda I, Sonda II, 
            Sonda III and Sonda IV, the VS-30, VS-40 and VSB-30.
    
            The VLS was cancelled after decades of development 
            and high expenditures with poor results and a failed 
            association with Ukraine that slowed the program 
            for years.
    
            VLS-1 development started in 1984, after the first 
            launch of the Sonda IV rocket. To date, three 
            prototypes have been built and two launches attempted,

            allowed the testing of several vehicle components. 
            The V3 prototype exploded on the launch pad on 22 
            August 2003, two days before its intended launch date. 
            The 2003 Alcântara VLS accident caused a considerable

            The VLM (Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites) is a 
            proposed three-stage satellite launcher being developed 
            by the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology 
            in collaboration with Germany. The project originated 
            in 2008 as a simplified version of the VLS-1 rocket, 
            using only the core stages.

            A version based on the S-50 rocket engine is being 
            developed, with the objective of launching satellites 
            of up to 150 kg into equatorial circular orbits at 
            300 km altitude.
            
            Development on VLM started in 2008 for the purpose of 
            low-cost and reliable launch of microsatellites. 
            Initially, a four-stage rocket using solid fuel was 
            proposed, arranged in the following order:

            Stage 1: S-43 rocket engine
            Stage 2: S-40TM rocket engine
            Stage 3: S-44 rocket engine
            Stage 4: S-33 rocket engine

            It was later decided in 2011 to build a precursor 
            single-stage rocket bearing a new engine called S-50. 
            The vehicle is being developed and its engine tested 
            in collaboration with the German Space Agency (DLR).
            This precursor test is called VS-50 and is planned for 
            launch in 2019. The VS-50 vehicle measures 12 m (39 ft) 
            long, 1.46 m (4 ft 9 in) in diameter, and has a mass of 
            about 15 tons.

            All launches are planned to take place from the Alcântara 
            Launch Center, located on Brazil's northern Atlantic coast.

            Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1) was small, solid fueled launch vehicle 
            based on the road mobile DF-21 IRBM with an additional 
            upper stage (in total 4 stages[1]). It was 13.6 meters 
            in length and 1.4 meters in diameter, with launch mass 
            of 20t. It was possible to launch KT-1 both from a 
            truck-based platform or from airborne platform. It had 
            a 100 kg to LEO payload capacity. It was possibly the 
            launch vehicle for a Chinese ASAT system that was tested 
            against an old Chinese weather satellite in 2007.

            The vehicle has performed two flights, the first in 15 
            September 2002 and the second 16 September 2003. The 
            first flight failed to place a 50 kg satellite into 
            polar orbit due to a second stage malfunction. The 
            second flight was also a failure, however Chinese 
            officials declared some success citing the guidance 
            systems, fairing separation and satellite-launcher 
            separation as successful. The second launch sent the 
            payload, PS-2 microsatellite (40 kg) into wrong orbit. 
            The satellite completed barely one orbit before 
            re-entering the atmosphere.
            
            The Kaituozhe-1 launcher appears to have been cancelled 
            after two unsuccessful launches. A third (in 2004) and 
            fourth launch have been rumored, but are not confirmed.
                        
            The rocket had three variants: the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1),

            Kuaizhou (KZ, Chinese: 快舟; pinyin: kuàizhōu, meaning 
            "speedy vessel") (also called Feitian Emergency Satellite 
            Launch System, Feitian-1, FT-1) is a family of Chinese 
            "quick-reaction" orbital launch vehicles. Flying since 
            2013, Kuaizhou 1 and 1A consist of three solid-fueled rocket 
            stages, with a liquid-fueled fourth stage as part of the 
            satellite system. Kuaizhou 11, which flew an unsuccessful 
            maiden flight in July 2020, is a larger model able to launch 
            a 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb) payload into low Earth orbit. 
            Heavy-lift models KZ-21 and KZ-31 are in development. The 
            Kuaizhou series of rockets is manufactured by ExPace, a 
            subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation 
            (CASIC), as their commercial launch vehicles.
            
            The rocket series is based on CASIC's ASAT and BMD mid-course 
            interceptor rockets, in particular the DF-21 IRBM (another 
            Chinese rocket that was based on DF-21 was the Kaituozhe-1). 
            Development on the KZ rockets started in 2009. The KZ rockets
            were to provide an integrated launch vehicle system with the 
            rapid ability to replace Chinese satellites that might be 
            damaged or destroyed in an act of aggression in orbit. The 
            vehicle uses mobile launch platform. The rocket is operated 
            by the Chinese 2nd Artillery.

            The maiden flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 1 
            natural disaster monitoring satellite, occurred on 25 September 
            2013, launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.
            
            Second flight of Kuaizhou 1 rocket, orbiting the Kuaizhou 2 natural 
            disaster monitoring satellite, was launched at 06:37 UTC on 21 
            November 2014, again from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.
            
            The first commercial launch inaugurated the Kuaizhou 1A version 
            on 9 January 2017, from Jiuquan. It placed three small satellites 
            into a polar orbit.

            The Long March 1 (长征一号), also known as the Changzheng-1 
            (CZ-1), was the first member of China's Long March rocket family.
            
            Development started in January 1965 as the Seventh Ministry 
            of Machinery Industry issued a design task. The two stage 
            liquid fueled DF-4 was modified by adding a third stage in 
            order to make it to the desired orbit. Long March 1's second 
            flight launched China's first satellite Dong Fang Hong 1 to 
            space on April 24, 1970. The rocket was operational during 
            1970–1971. Wang Xiji was the chief designer of the rocket.
